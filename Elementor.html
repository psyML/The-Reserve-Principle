var HVeryHigh='<h3>Honesty-Humility</h3><br><br>Your life and how you live it is an outgrowth of your worldview. You are less interested in what you can “get” from life than how you participate in it. You live out of who you are, out of your sense of purpose, and that gives you a sense of meaning that external results in and of themselves can’t.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   You tend to evaluate yourself by your own measures, which is very valuable in terms of allowing you to grow in ways that fit who you are, but the outside world may judge you by in their own terms. <br>•   If their judgments of you impact your sense of purpose or your sense of self, that might cause you stress, which could, in turn, affect your ability to manage the situation to your fullest. <br>•   People very high in honesty-humility live with an integrity that others may not, but there’s no way to explain that to those who don’t. So part of managing the outside voices in your life is to stay dedicated to the messages you feed yourself, including what you identify as authentic to you and that which is someone else’s opinion.<br>•   This can be hard to do at times, but your stability and growth depend on deciding each day what your message is to yourself and making sure, as best you can, that your attitudes and actions live out of that.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   It takes a special person to dedicate themselves to living with integrity every day. Being able to maintain your sense of identity and live out of your worldview amidst the cacophony of distractions that are part of daily life is on the path to exceptionality.<br>•   Knowing which voices actually have your best interest at heart is also probably going to be an important learning curve because some people may read your disinterest in the world’s standards as gullibility, as meaning that you don’t understand how the world works.<br>•   They may try to take advantage of you or exert influence on you in order to get what they want. It’s often very difficult for people to let someone find their own path, which you are doing.<br>•   Having the daily fortitude to maintain that and keep the course you’ve set—perhaps at times even being willing to adjust it or recalibrate according to what you learn along the way—is essential to living exceptionally.<br>•   The more your own voice and vision stand out in your own mind and are clear, the less your reserve will be taxed and the better you will be able to manage your own pursuits.<br>•   Maintaining healthy exercise and diet routines will go a long way towards this.'
var HHigh='<h3>Honesty-Humility</h3><br>You are naturally forthright in the way that you approach people and life. You’re not in the hunt to get ahead, to outdo or outsmart others in an effort to make your mark on the world. You, instead, determine for yourself what success looks like in your life. It comes from within.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Learning how to Live with Reserve requires acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses, areas that you shine in and areas that you can improve in. Because you look within for meaning instead of outside of yourself, you may not at times understand why others are driven by their need to pursue things that are not of great value to you.<br>•   Since accruing more and moving up in status is a societal standard, you may get frustrated at times if you get overlooked or feel undervalued because you’re not trying to manipulate every situation to benefit yourself. As a result, you may get less attention than those who do. <br>•   Not everyone is aware that people who put their heads down and get things done actually keep the world moving along. The person who does the work doesn’t always get the credit.<br>•   And it’s not that you’re fundamentally interested in credit, but you likely feel that your contribution, especially because it’s an outgrowth of who you are, deserves acknowledgement—not fanfare or applause.<br>•   Living from your own values and sense of self is a rewarding way of life, but it is often in conflict with what the world values.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   You have an innate exceptionality by not following the norm, by not looking outside yourself for your purpose and validation. The uncertainty you may face at times, which affects living with Reserve, is how to get your needs met in the context of your choice to live from within.<br>•   Just because you’re not a glory-seeker or a gameplayer doesn’t mean that you don’t need affirmation and encouragement, so knowing how to communicate these needs in ways that fit with who you are is essential to your sense of security and success.<br>•   This may seem counterintuitive, but just because you aren’t trying to climb over others on the ladder of success doesn’t make you immune from needing others.<br>•   Admitting to yourself what you need from others—and not becoming prideful about not playing the game the way others do—will enable you to feel even better about the path you’ve chosen, a path that is guided by being true to yourself.<br>•   The danger, otherwise, is that you can become annoyed or resentful when that which you have so heavily invested in goes unnoticed or you feel is underappreciated. You probably don’t need much, but expressing what you do need and finding out that you can get it will help you live with Reserve.<br>•   Having a healthy way to vent or discuss the frustrations you come up against will also help you maintain your sense of well-being. Emotional health is integral to living with Reserve.'
var HMedium='<h3>Honesty-Humility</h3><br>You tend to incorporate different approaches to developing meaning and purpose in your life. Whereas some look primary internally for their motivation and sense of meaning and others look more purposively at how they can validate themselves by external achievement, you employ both.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Because you combine internal and external approaches to finding fulfillment in your life, you give yourself some variety when it comes to living with Reserve. You’re not tied to one type of measure, which means that you have some versatility.<br>•   Living with Reserve comes into play for you when you struggle to make sense of what is of more value to you in a moment, going after a measurable marker of success or living out of what you believe is important.<br>•   Thus, at times, this may also provide a kind of push-pull in your life because you may be torn with which type of approach fits a given situation.<br>•   Just as well, though, you have times that live out of both simultaneously, which can be an advantage because you will be able to feel like you are feeding your desire to let your values be your guide while also seeing tangible that corroborate these values. The external achievements can reflect the internal energy that drives you.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Part of being exceptional is realizing that choices are often not “either-or” propositions but “both-and.” Because of your approach to life, you have a great opportunity to put this into play every day.<br>•   When you feel torn between what motivates you and what you want to achieve, you can help yourself by reminding yourself that the two can function together. How you see your choices is essential to living from Reserve. You have exceptionality within you, and your ability to live out of it is tied to how you regulate uncertainty that you face in your life.<br>•   Living with Reserve also means being able to anticipate acute stress so that you can operate more fully out of who you are. Identifying your own patterns of comfort—your decision-making processes that are in conjunction with your identity—and looking to those when you are faced with decisions that seem less clear will help you maintain Reserve.<br>•   You may also like to push the boundaries in life, to see what’s possible. This is certainly within the realm of living with Reserve, but knowing the key markers of what give you stability will enhance your ability to push into new vistas.<br>•   During times of stress, sleep quantity and quality can be more important. Rest provides stability that there are few substitutes for.'
var HLow='<h3>Honesty-Humility</h3><br>You do what you feel you must in order to get your needs met. This allows you to get the most out of your time and to get direct attention to what you value. You may have to put yourself ahead of others in the process, but you feel like everyone should be responsible for themselves. You have to take care of your own pursuits: no one is going to do it for you.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Living with Reserve has its challenges, one of which is learning how to deal with uncertainty. Your trust in yourself is a great asset because you’re willing to take the action needed to progress in your life.<br>•   At the same time, trusting in yourself can be a hindrance if it means that you trust your assessment of most any situation over others. Part of living with Reserve is recognizing that finding a balance between self-reliance and finding your place in a community allows you to live a more effective life.<br>•   If you have such trust in yourself that you believe that you know the shortest path to your desired destination, you may get in your own way. Being part of a community relieves stress and contributes to a sense of meaning and purpose that has its own merit.<br>•   Your efforts have merit of their own and deserve recognition too, but they can also complement the effort you put into developing a broader spectrum of relationships that you cultivate, relationships that aren’t necessarily for the purpose of gaining an advantage.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Your ability to read the world around you is a strength that gives you an advantage when it comes to excelling at what you most want to pursue. Exceptionality also means knowing when an advantage can be a liability and what to do with it when it is.<br>•   You likely draw on your ability to see through situations, to identify how to get where you want to go quickly, but if this constantly impels you forward, you may also be operating under quite a bit of stress much of the time.<br>•   Instead, you can live with greater Reserve by learning how to better employ your insightfulness not just to get ahead but to be a part of the world in which you operate.<br>•   Everyone has blind spots in their evaluation of the world they encounter, so being able to put your own motivations aside so that you can draw from a broader number of voices can enhance your sense of security.<br>•   If you don’t think you can “get ahead” without maneuvering into the most advantageous positions, you will probably fall short of the exceptionality you can achieve otherwise. This mentality pits you against the world in some ways, which can be very isolating and lonely. Rethinking what security really is, where certainty really comes from, can help you embrace a major growing edge: you don’t have to go it alone. Building with others can work too.<br>•   Looking for ways to get and give social support will help. This may mean looking for groups who share similar interests and engaging in them. Or it might mean finding a place that you get your needs met that you don’t otherwise. It could be anything that is communal in nature.'
var HVeryLow='<h3>Honesty-Humility</h3><br>You’re willing to do what you need to in order to get ahead. The world is a competitive place, and you realize that you can get the upper hand through your own savvy and ability to put yourself in advantageous positions. You likely pride yourself in being able to get the most out of just about any situation.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   You understand that getting where you want to go takes self-application. It’s one of your strengths. Living with Reserve, however, is more than getting what you want out of a given situation.<br>•   In one aspect, Living with Reserve means anticipating your needs and making a plan about how to satisfy them ahead of time, which you understand as well as anyone. The challenge for you is that Living with Reserve also means that stress can accumulate in unnoticed ways.<br>•   You likely are very self-reliant and apply your savvy because it gives you a sense of control about the outcome or a sense of satisfaction when you are able to influence things to your benefit, but that doesn’t mean that you are not under a lot of stress in the process.<br>•   It may be fun, even exhilarating, to outfox others and achieve what you set out to, but there may also be a price. Stress accumulates in a number of ways when we are not integrating a combination of approaches to create a sense of meaning, purpose, and stability.<br>•   The toll that this overload of stress takes can be renegotiated in a way that allows you to operate from Reserve and feel less compelled to function primarily as an independent agent who is left to survive according to your own resources. The world is a much bigger, more trusting place than many give it credit for being. We just have to begin to believe it, and then we will see it.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   So, a first option is to consider that it’s not every person for themselves. You’ve done this and had success doing it in some regard probably, but it’s not the only way. Putting “it all” on your shoulders is too much for anyone to handle.<br>•   Sharing your challenges, frustrations, successes, hopes, and goals with others actually shares the burdens and the joys in a way that provides a more rejuvenated type of security. You are still an individual who has done something exceptional but instead of walking down the aisle of success alone, you can have a small or larger group of comrades who cheer you on.<br>•   It’s not easy to move into this type of exceptionality when you are so good at getting ahead by your own plans and devices, but exceptionality itself has to be defined in more holistic terms if its going to have the type of substance that is truly satisfying.<br>•   Authentic satisfaction comes from participating in life along a number of lines, not just by achieving the goal you set out to. In fact, reaching the goal can be empty compared to the process of getting there.<br>•   That’s why moving beyond the results can be so rewarding: even when things go sideways, when that which you spend so much time and energy anticipating doesn’t happen, you aren’t left holding the bag by yourself. The highs and lows will just be different, primarily because you’ll be operating from Reserve instead of self-propulsion, which though it can feel good, is often very taxing.<br>•   Part of embracing a life lived from Reserve also means taking care of yourself physically, in terms of exercise and diet. These are easy to overlook since they take time, but they are essential to everything that you do. Everything begins with the body. If it is not taken care of, eventually everything else becomes harder, if not unmanageable.'
    var EVeryHigh="<h3>Emotionality</h3><br>You have an exceptional ability to pick up on the emotional tenor of most any situation. Your innate sense of what others are feeling gives you a sensitivity to life that is in many ways a gift and a challenge.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Living with Reserve means learning how to manage the uncertainties that come into life on a daily basis. Many of the uncertainties you face arise without much notice as you navigate through your day because you are extremely aware of all stimuli you encounter.<br>•   This can be positive and/or difficult depending on what you come across. At times, your own fears and anxieties may be heightened and difficult to regulate, especially if the touchstones of your own stress are triggered.<br>•   Emotions are generally good and help us organize what we are experiencing, but if they become too intense or overwhelming, they can be limiting or even debilitating. Learning how to make them an even greater strength is a worthwhile endeavor.<br>•   For you, this means developing an even more effective way to manage your emotions so that you don’t overload yourself. This is what it means to live with Reserve.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Managing your response to the world around you is probably in large part going to be preemptive. Pursuing exceptionality requires preparation, so taking care of yourself is essential to how your responses to life manifest.<br>•   This likely means treating your body well, particularly in terms of diet and exercise. Connecting with the body is key to our emotional lives, so making this part of your routine of life will help you feel connected to yourself and even more capable of responding to stressful situations in ways that are healthy for you.<br>•   Maintaining a solid base from which you operate—by taking care of your emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual needs—will give you a sense of purpose and confidence as you live into your own exceptionality. It’s clearly there; it just needs support.<br>•   Meeting your needs also means knowing what situations you thrive in and which ones you need to avoid or get out of as quickly as possible. Make conscious note of what situations tend to encourage you, help you to feel even more like yourself, and which ones cause you immediate discomfort and/or overwhelm you.<br>•   Operating out of this knowledge will allow you to live with Reserve, will allow you to maintain a sense of stability through change."
    var EHigh="<h3>Emotionality</h3>You have a natural ability to empathize with people and, as a result, have a natural affinity to connect with them. You forge this tie with others because you are an emotionally in-tune person, though it can also cause you difficulty.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Because you are attuned to other people’s emotional state, you have the ability to anticipate their needs, maybe even before they do. This can be beneficial in a variety of ways when it allows you to enhance the quality of their lives and your own.<br>•   At the same time, you may use your ability to read others’ emotions as a form of self-protection, i.e. as a survival skill. This is not healthy and causes stress, even if it’s not at a conscious level. Survival skills tax your system in a number of ways.<br>•   When you are facing stressful circumstances, you probably become anxious. This is true for many people, but being aware of that you feel this way, that you react this way, is essential if you want to change it. It’s also something you can build on once you see it clearly.<br>•   Living with Reserve requires moving from reacting to responding. Your sensitivity to the people around you is an asset that you can grow and develop so that what might today be fearful or anxiety-producing can tomorrow be manageable and doable.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Gaining a greater sense of control over the world you interact with is an empowering proposition for most people. For you, your sensitivity towards others reveals your warmth, and learning how to channel that warmth even more will enable you to decrease your stress and increase your quality of life.<br>•   For people who are so responsive to others’ emotions, part of becoming more exceptional is checking in with your own emotions on a regular basis and owning them, no matter what they are. You may have a affinity for connecting with others, but this is not a substitute for your own interior work.<br>•   Living an exceptional life often means making small adjustments to the way we relate to the world we encounter. As you learn more about how to not just anticipate others’ needs but how to anticipate your own and assert them, you will have greater freedom in all areas of your life. You have so much to offer.<br>•   As you live more fully in Reserve, your confidence in yourself will grow and your ability to maintain a sense of stability through change will give you increased resolve to venture out in new ways, ways that you may have hoped for or not even yet realized or dreamed.<br>•   Exercise is especially important for you as it helps maintain your emotional state. Keeping a regular schedule—and it doesn’t have to be in large quantities—will make a big difference in how you perceive the world around you and how you feel about yourself. So will staying connected to those you care about and who care about you."
    var EMedium="<h3>Emotionality</h3>You try to keep a balance when it comes to how you relate to the world. You are regularly involved in other people’s lives and enjoy it, but you prefer to be a part of their lives without being enmeshed in them. You invest in them and hope, to some degree, they do in you, but you know your own limits and try to live by them.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   “Nobody knows the trouble I’ve seen. Nobody knows my sorrow.” These are not lyrics that you want for your life, nor do they likely reflect your life. You, by contrast, are aware when trouble is near and likely have the sense when to get involved in when not to.<br>•   This is key for living with Reserve because stress is largely reduced by being able to respond in healthy and effective ways as tense or demanding situations unfold.<br>•   Just because you are an aware person, at least in terms of how you do and don’t want to be involved, doesn’t mean that you don’t/won’t find yourself in stressful situations. That’s life, right?<br>•   Therefore, what you do when you are affected by something you didn’t consent to is key to living with Reserve because maintaining stability through change is what operating at a higher level is all about.<br>•   Most everyone has the ability to revert to a fight or flight mentality in times of trial, so your well-being is tied to having a sense of what types of people or situations call this up in you. It can happen without much notice.<br>•   Having a sense of this will help you rely on more healthy ways of dealing with unfavorable feelings within yourself and/or unfavorable situations in which you find yourself.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Living out of who you are, out of what you value and how you want to participate in the world, is an audacious and wonderful quest. And like most quests, traveling uncharted territory is part of the journey.<br>•   Fortunately, your pursuit of exceptionality is in your hands, at your behest, requires your heart and soul, and you are likely up for the challenge.<br>•   The biggest challenge you likely face are the moments of doubt that are inevitable on such a journey. Knowing who to trust, who to share your experience of this with as you grow, is an essential part of making the leaps you are pursuing.<br>•   Living with Reserve is not for the faint of heart, so it must be for the courageous. This means embracing your own exceptionality, regardless of what you discover that looks like. Expectations can be a limitation of their own, so while anticipating how to deal with challenges is part of living with Reserve, being open to what happens, what you encounter, without judging it is one of your strengths. Continue to embrace it.<br>•   Taking care of your health is essential to such a quest. Your body is one of your greatest allies, so remember to treat it as such. Regular exercise and a well-balanced diet will place you in an even better position to manage the strides you want to take as you take them. Forward!"
    var ELow="<h3>Emotionality</h3><br>The ups and downs of life do not really show up on your radar, or if they do, they affect you very little. You don’t get worked up about things that other people do and, in turn, generally don’t understand why they’re stressed. You rarely feel like life is overwhelming or that your welfare is threatened in any way.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   You pretty much go with the flow, not really seeing much to be bothered by or apprehensive about in your day-to-day activities. You don’t anticipate pain or discomfort in most any circumstance, and so you probably don’t experience much of either.<br>•   Just because you don’t experience them doesn’t mean that you are seeing everything that is happening. Part of living with Reserve is having an awareness of how to regulate uncertainty as it crops up.<br>•   If, however, you don’t experience uncertainty in response to life’s challenges, which causes most people discomfort or stress, you may not be in touch with what is happening.<br>•   You may very much (or even to a degree) want to be more in tune with what’s happening around you, but for whatever reason, you haven’t developed as much as you’d like along these lines.<br>•   Becoming more connected to the world in which you live, while it may be foreign or even odd at first, offers you a relationship to yourself and others that you may not know or know very well up to this point.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   You likely have a sense of control about your life, and this is largely good in terms of living with Reserve. If you, at the same time, are disconnected from parts of yourself and others in conjunction with being in control, this isn’t as good for you.<br>•   Life is fundamentally about relationships—with yourself, others, ideas, beliefs, dreams—so connecting more palpably with these often means that we are establishing deeper roots for our lives.<br>•   Living with Reserve can help you water these roots and make greater sense of your place in the world around you. Things are sometimes less stable in this world, but that’s what roots are for: stabilizing you in times of stress that are real.<br>•   It’s one thing to overreact to events around us—which you are unlikely to do. It’s another thing entirely to not react when life calls for a response. This is something to grow toward.<br>•   You have the ability to be exceptional as you extend your roots by investing in a variety of networks with people who want to connect with you. Making the effort to reach beyond your typical spheres of activity, to make more personal connections with others, offers you a way of living with Reserve that is potentially richer than you’d imagined.<br>   Not surprisingly, there are physical aspects to living with Reserve, especially when considering that emotions are influenced by the body’s chemistry. That being said, good eating habits and avoiding drug and alcohol consumption are often key to balancing these other aspects of life."
    var EVeryLow="<h3>Emotionality</h3><br>You’re basically immune to worry: it doesn’t show up in your life. You rarely feel like things are weighing on you and are even less likely to have fear about anything. Instead of bracing yourself for stress or the prospect of difficulty, you just barrel forward, not real concerned about it.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   As much of a relief it is to live without worry or fear, your ability to walk through life without either may mean that you are disconnected from the experiences that others, in the same situation, are having.<br>•   Even though you are not stressed by life, this is not necessarily helpful in every instance because when challenges do present themselves or fear might be a reasonable response, you might walk right into it without seeing it for what it is. This can be dangerous and/or harmful.<br>•   This could cause you harm or those around you, depending on what it is. Living with Reserve becomes an issue for you not because you’re trying to manage stress but because you don’t interpret threatening events, for example, as being so, which means that you won’t be prepared.<br>•   Living with Reserve means being able to anticipate what situations need and planning for them. You cannot do this if you are disconnected from what is happening.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Social integration is a very valuable part of living with Reserve. Being able to observe behavioral cues and markers that others do and responding to them in meaningful ways can add depth and significance to your life.<br>•   While you may not feel isolated from others, that doesn’t mean that you’re not. Part of your growth is to see where there is an opportunity to develop and pursue it. For you, this likely means becoming more aware of your feelings. This may be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary if you want to pursue your own exceptionality.<br>•   Human beings are social creatures, and there is no replacing this. Learning new ways to connect broadens your experience of the world in which you live. Taking steps toward interacting with a wider range of social groups and activities may help you grow in this regard.<br>•   As you develop your connection with others more, the chances are that you will see the world through new lenses, feel a sense of purpose that perhaps was there all along but didn’t burn in you in the same way. As physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual beings, the more each of these aspects is activated, the greater our ability to live with Reserve.<br>•   Exercise and diet are particularly critical to a healthy emotional life. Many people’s emotions are affected by poor diet, so making sure you carry out an effective weekly meal plan, so to speak, will also aid your living into the Reserve you’re striving for."
var XVeryHigh ="<h3>Extraversion</h3><br>You’d rather be among a group of people than anywhere. You likely look for as many ways as you can to find ways to engage socially and feel the most alive when around others. You get an energy from being amongst people that you cannot replicate in any other context. It makes you feel alive and very confident.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Living with Reserve is tied to your sense of well-being, so it’s natural for you to be around others constantly. This is where you are most likely to feel relaxed and able to enjoy who you are.<br>•   When there are respites from the social nature that you’ve organized your life around—and everyone has these—you may feel less inclined to either do them or commit to them. This could refer to the day-to-day responsibilities that everyone has or other tasks that life’s maintenance requires.<br>•   You like feeling connected to others, in large part because it allows you to connect to yourself, so if you haven’t developed ways to check in with yourself, you may get inundated with the intoxication that you find in being engulfed with people.<br>•   Being around people is not enough, in and of itself, for any extravert, even when it feels good. Living with Reserve also means making the most out of what gives you energy. This requires the daily self-care that is not always social stimulating.<br>•   In other words, while others often help you recharge and feel your best, knowing how and when to rest, where to invest in your own physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health, are also important.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Living with Reserve is fundamentally about maintaining stability through change, which also includes being adaptable when acute stress rears its head.<br>•   So in order to achieve the exceptionality your are pursuing, you will also have to see where you can add some balance to the different areas of your life. You tend toward the very high end of social interaction, which has many positives, but when overdone, this too can be hard on you in the long run.<br>•   Creating some built-in self-care, some ways of tending to your needs that are less social and more personal is essential to living your fullest life. This may be in terms of the quality of your relationships (meaning evaluating what you want out of them beyond the social aspect). It may also refer to reviewing how you spend your time and money, which are foundation stones when it comes to quality of life.<br>•   Uncertainty is part of life, which is why learning to operate out of greater Reserve is so helpful and beneficial. When you face uncertainty, you may have a tendency to whip up your social life in order to distract you, but it’s important to remember that dealing with unknown aspects of life as they arise is supremely important so that you can resolve them and live from a place of contentment, not anxiety.<br>•   You have a lot going for you because you are already so engage with people. Making sure you are doing the things that contribute to your own health are also key, like maintaining a routine of physical exercise and eating well on a daily basis. These both take time and may (but don’t have to be) less social than you’d prefer (cooking and what-not), but they’re worth investing in as they will empower the rest of the life that you want and enjoy."
var XHigh="<h3>Extraversion</h3><br>You like people and being around people. In fact, that’s where you are at your best and most comfortable. You excel in social situations because you feel good about yourself when engaging with others and find meaning in their responding to you. You likely even feel at ease, or perhaps excited, when addressing a group of people, large or small.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   You know what gives you a sense of purpose and how to build your life around what makes you tick. You don’t have to look far to see that you are all about people.<br>•   Nothing invigorates you like being in a group of people. Knowing that you get energy from others empowers you to get your needs met on a regular basis. Since you are also in the pursuit of exceptionality, it’s worth mentioning that setting yourself up for success in this regard, be it in the type of work you do or the types of relationships you engage in, is key to the attaining a full life.<br>•   Human beings are naturally social creatures, so you benefit in many areas of your life by feeling so comfortable among others. Taking time for self-reflection along the way is also helpful because being an individual doesn’t preclude being part of group: in fact, the two can work quite well together.<br>•   In other words, even though you love people, identifying your own needs, alongside the group and as an individual, can continue to create a beautiful symbiosis that fosters your individual needs, desire, and goals while incorporating you into the groups in which you so thrive.<br>•   If times occur in which you feel disconnected from the social life you crave, or something about your social or work life changes, continue reaching out as you are so good at doing. You will find your way back to your Reserve through re-engagement and some reflection along the way.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   As you go through transitions in your life—and everyone does—acknowledging the changing nature of things is an important part of the process. Even though you’re more adaptable than most, stating what is actually happening relieves whatever pressure is present, at least to a degree.<br>•   Then you can go forward with your usual energy and optimism because living into your own exceptionality is something you probably already do. You believe in yourself and tend to develop connections with people that give you meaning.<br>•   If at times you see that some relationships—with people, jobs, or other parts of your life—aren’t meeting your needs, you can adjust. Changing these may not always be the first choice, as humans are also creatures of habit, but you’re trying to optimize your life, to do something that most people aren’t willing to do.<br>•   When uncertainty peeks out from behind the blinds as you open the curtains to new chapters in your life, you have the ability to embrace the light shining, even if it’s blinding at first because you have a fearless quality about you that you can call on. You are very capable.<br>•   As you cultivate an even more integrated and meaningful life, stresses often crop up along the way. The degree to which you tend to your mind and body are essential to living with Reserve. Your body will only take you so far as you take it, so eat healthy foods and exercise regularly. Many people sacrifice these for a number of reasons, but finding ways to prepare food or work out with others might be a good option."
var XMedium="<h3>Extraversion</h3><br>Sometimes you really enjoy being around people, and at other times you just want to relax by yourself or a with a few others. This is part of who you are, and it gives you some variety. You tend to trust your gut on this, though you also realize that you don’t always get to choose which you get to do. Life has its own demands, and you try to be flexible.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Not everyone is as versatile as you are in this regard. Some people fall more towards one or the other, really preferring to be with people all the time or preferring to be by themselves. Since you can be both, you have the opportunity to relate to both extraverts and introverts.<br>•   The challenge is when people mistake you as being one or the other (introvert or extravert), depending on how they’ve encountered you. With this comes certain expectations, and being pigeonholed is not much fun either way. How you deal with friends who may not understand your desire to spend the evening in when they want to go out will inform how well you are able to live with Reserve.<br>•   Part of living with Reserve is being able to regulate your own needs so that you are not overdrawing on your energy accounts on a regular basis. Energy can be mental, emotional, physical, or spiritual. That is why it is such a challenge to live with greater Reserve: there are likely constant demands on your time and attention.<br>•   Identifying your own needs in any particular moment is one of the most important skills when navigating the stresses of life. Simple choices, including the ability to not do what the group wants some of the time, can make a big difference.<br>•   If you feel torn between the demands of life, part of living with Reserve is thinking ahead about how you can get what you need over more than just the next decision. Being able to see beyond the immediate situation and plan for yourself enables you to live a life that is more pleasing and nourishing.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   If you feel like you are doing a good job staying true to the little voice inside that tells you what you need, then you are on good footing. This is certainly easier said than done since most people are pulled in multiple directions. <br>•   Maintaining that footing is aided by a variety of behaviors that, when integrated into your life on an ongoing basis, provide the opportunity to live even more fully from Reserve. These include having a healthy diet (particularly fresh foods, not processed) and doing at least moderate exercise, which has numerous benefits. It also includes getting good sleep and plenty of it, as well as being a part of social circles that enhance your life.<br>•   If you struggle with listening to the little voice that (usually) has your best interests at heart, regardless of what they may be, then the road to exceptionality is going to be more difficult because each choice affects the next choice.<br>•   This means that when poor choices are made, stress begins to pile up, in turn impacting your ability to live with Reserve. Your well-being and sense of purpose are enabled to the degree that you maintain your sense of self, which is admittedly hard to do at times. <br>•   So the pursuit of an exceptional life means living with courage, embracing the challenges that come with making changes and transcending your life up to this point. But you can do it, and Living with Reserve is here to help you do it.<br>•   Physical health is also important, so the better care you take of yourself physically, the more lithe you’ll be in tackling life’s challenges and in taking care of yourself. These are not easy challenges, but they are worth it to create an even more amazing life."
var XLow="<h3>Extraversion</h3><br>You live an introspective life. This means that you prefer to process the world you encounter for yourself before sharing your experience of it with others. You may come across as private, and may actually be a private person, but you’re not trying to come across in any particular way. It’s just how you relate to the world.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Despite living in a society that largely rewards extraversion, you excel and do well for yourself. Introverts are often misunderstood as not liking people or being “shy,” but this is not typically the case.<br>•   You process your life in a different way than extraverts, so since it’s not on display, so to speak, not as publicly observable, people may have less access to the way that you make meaning in your life and therefore wonder or even jump to conclusions.<br>•   That doesn’t mean that you don’t include others in your life or that they are integral to the meaning you form in your life. There are different ways of being, even though being gregarious and likeable are more highly touted. <br>•   All of this is to say that being an introvert is every bit as valuable as other ways of being. That needs to be clearly and overtly stated and affirmed because it often is not. The rub, of course, is that life may require social situations that are not as preferable to you, i.e. groups of people, along the way, so learning more about how to anticipate your own needs can be a great help in terms of living with Reserve.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Because exceptionality and its pursuit are not the norm, growth is required. You are going to be able to build on what you already have developed by applying your interior sense of self to new cultivations.<br>•   More particularly, living with Reserve challenges you to augment the parts of yourself that are not as developed so that you can get the most out of all of you. This doesn’t mean becoming a different person but just being willing to see what areas of your life you can improve and then making needed adjustments.<br>•   For you, you need to become an extravert. Just kidding! (You knew it, right?) No, in fact, that would be entirely counterproductive and probably cause you to retreat. Instead, living with Reserve means learning how to maintain stability through change and, because of this, be more adaptable to stress without being drained of your resources.<br>•   Therefore, being yourself yet moving toward greater integration is the key. Efficiently regulating your own stress means learning how to better anticipate your own mental and emotional needs so that you can plan how to satisfy them ahead of time. <br>•   That’s not to say that unexpected events or situations won’t present themselves but that you will have a greater retinue of options for how to get through such occurrences without overtaxing yourself.<br>•   Not putting unneeded stress on yourself in other areas of life certainly helps. People who watch their alcohol intake and avoid smoking reduce their stress significantly with that alone. Another aspect of maintaining Reserve is social integration. Being a part of groups that are a size you like and that have a purpose you enjoy will also help you to live with and from Reserve."
var XVeryLow="<h3>Extraversion</h3><br>You’d rather keep to yourself than interact with others. You probably find engaging with others to be a lot of work, maybe even tiresome, so you tend to do things alone or with a few choice people. You’re happy with your own interior world and would rather not have to manage all the things that come with socializing in groups.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Your ability to cultivate your own interior life is a great asset, especially in a world that is constantly looking outside itself for meaning and affirmation.<br>•   The challenge you face occurs when tending to your inner world steers toward or into isolation. You can almost literally leave yourself behind by doing this because human engagement is borne in human beings from very early stages of development. So if that becomes excluded from one’s life—regardless of what caused or contributes to it—the person going through it is going to struggle in different aspects of life.<br>•   Social integration is one of the key components of living with Reserve. This is not by coincidence because people who have more developed social networks typically have a greater network of relationships and resources and, as a result, gain a sense of fulfillment for which there really isn’t another substitute.<br>•   This is not to say that maintaining a private life is in and of itself “wrong” or impossible in order to achieve excellence: that would make no sense at all and be refuted by examples of dozens of people’s lives. <br>•   However, living with Reserve means living a more fully integrated life so that no single part is strained or has to carry the load for the other parts. In fact, it can’t. It’d be like expecting your neck to carry the weight for your whole body. It’s hilarious and ridiculous: sharing the weight down your entire spinal column just makes sense.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Moving toward a more integrated life is often neither easy or comfortable. If your spine were misaligned and you learned there were exercises that you could do to relieve the stress put on it, you’d probably make the effort. To do so would open up other areas of healing and rejuvenation, maybe in ways you couldn’t have anticipated.<br>•   The same goes for living with Reserve, for learning new ways to become part of life. You’ve got a good connection with your interior self, so increasing the quality of your life is going to mean retraining some of the vertebrae and muscles that regulate your life. This might include learning new ways to deal with stress as it arises. This will give you a greater sense of control over your environment as you face challenges, be they social or otherwise.<br>•   Again, you’re not being asked to change your personality as being introverted is not good or bad. It’s simply a matter of looking at aspects of your life that might not have received as much attention but have been waiting to be nurtured and developed.<br>•   If you are a serious introvert, you probably feel threatened by many of life’s scenarios that are just part of life for most people. Learning how to manage your fear in these situations will, in and of itself, bring fresh light into the world in which you live and inevitable open you up to new experiences and new ways of enjoying and participating in life. That’s what living with Reserve is all about!<br>•   Certain factors that will help along the way are participating in physical activity on a regular basis and getting enough and good sleep nightly. Taking care of your body is a key component of living with Reserve because the stress your body undergoes affects every other part of your life. You’ll also feel better about yourself and more confident as a result because body chemistry certainly plays into emotions and a sense of well-being."
var AVeryHigh="<h3>Agreeableness</h3>You almost always put others’ needs ahead of your own. You cannot wait to help most anyone that you can and see the world as a place that needs more love and kindness. So you look to provide it every chance that you get, regardless of the cost to you. You give freely and without desire for recompense, in part because it gives you great pleasure.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Being a giver is a wonderful thing because much of the world is more preoccupied with getting rather than giving. You are attempting to balance the scale a little bit by dedicating yourself to others.<br>•   Seeing others’ needs as so primary likely means that their care is of greater concern to you than your own. This is in many ways a lovely way to live but has to also be weighed in terms of its sustainability. Giving does feed you, which is wonderful, but givers must also find nourishment in order to keep feeding others. <br>•   Living with Reserve means having the best base possible from which to operate, to have as few deficits as you can so that you are not continually having stress affect you. Stress does not have to be conscious for it to impact your life.<br>•   The question then is what measures do you need to monitor in terms of self-care? A quick “I’m alright” may work from time to time, but more generally, looking more thoroughly at your own levels of satisfaction with work, relationships, finances, and personal pursuits is essential. Your physical health is also a factor in your ability to live with Reserve.<br>•   After reviewing these as honestly as you can—which is hard—you can put your best foot forward because helping others will come from a place of even greater fullness. Even the most giving of souls have to get their own needs met at some level.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   You clearly want an exceptional life because you make a supreme effort to ensure that others have one. Giving is likely part of your vision for an exceptional life for yourself.<br>•   Your own exceptionality is made possible by several things, including operating from a surplus, not a deficit. In other words, the greater your sense of stability across all areas of your life, the more enhanced your ability is to contribute to others. <br>•   Getting to a place of stability may take some time and will certainly take some effort because everyone has areas of their lives in which they can improve/be clearer with themselves about. But doing so can transform your life as you learn more ways to improve yourself and how you live with Reserve.<br>•   Part of living with Reserve is getting a handle on the areas of your life that cause uncertainty so that you can have a plan for dealing with your own discomforts as they arise. It’s not that you can know what’s coming, but you can become better prepared for whatever vicissitudes enter into your life uninvited or unawares.<br>•   Your physical health is also paramount because dedicated givers often neglect their own well-being in order to care for others. You don’t have to do that, though, because self-care, through even moderate exercise and a balanced diet, can propel far beyond. The body is the starting point for all care because without its support, the rest becomes untenable or overwhelming."
var AHigh="<h3>Agreeableness</h3>You are a nurturer by nature. You have a heart for forgiveness and feel no need to judge the deeds of others. Your caring approach, not surprisingly, means that you favor cooperation over competition and compromise over conflict. You’re able to navigate rough waters because you are even keel, regardless of how high the waves may crash.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   People who are natural nurturers offer the world something vital. Human beings need to be cared for by people who genuinely care. Your willingness and ability to treat people with compassion and gentleness enhances the quality of their lives.<br>•   Reaching out to others is part of your purpose in the world, and it gives you meaning. You participate in building your own Reserve by supporting others, in part because it gives you a sense of self-esteem and buoys your own well-being.<br>•   As someone who favors cooperation over competition, you naturally live with Reserve because you are less likely to add unnecessary stress to your own life through the conflicts that result from competing with others, be it for resources, attention, love, or the like.<br>•   The primary checkpoint for you as a nurturer is to continue to monitor the degree to which you let others nurture or give to you. Sometimes it’s hard for nurturers to receive, but this is essential to your overall health too.<br>•   If you have a hard time receiving, it may be because receiving is more vulnerable in some ways than being on the giving side. The quality of life, though, is often tied to one’s willingness to be vulnerable.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Your exceptionality is a natural outgrowth of your personality. You have an innate altruism about you that brings joy and light into the world. In order to make the most of your nurturing gifts, looking at ways that you can live even more with Reserve can help.<br>•   Part of living with Reserve for you should include a range of activities with peers. Social integration is a wonderful source of nourishment that reduces stress and replenishes the soul. This means being involved in a variety of social activities and relationships. <br>•   It also means acknowledging that you have a need for community wherein there is some reciprocity and you can play different roles. You may be giving, or you may just be participating, or even receiving from others.<br>•   Maintaining a sense of stability comes from tending to all aspects of your life, including the emotional, intellectual, physical, and spiritual. You may be naturally fed emotionally and spiritually by the way you care for others, so reviewing how you tend to your physical and intellectual needs is important too.<br>•   Regarding the physical, diet and rest are very important and often undervalued in society at large. Well-prepared food and sleep are often sacrificed because they take time, but they are indispensable for living with Reserve. Exercise is important too."
var AMedium="<h3>Agreeableness</h3>You understand how to socialize in meaningful ways with others, but you aren’t of the belief that you have to go along with the group in order to be a part of the group. In other words, you’re happy to voice your own ideas but don’t generally worry about the degree to which others agree. If you choose to get involved, it’s likely because you enjoy participating.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Being in relationship with others means many things to you. You are certainly capable of cooperating with others, but you may also enjoy competition from time to time. In other words, you choice how to engage with others based on who you are. <br>•   If you see the need to support someone, you may choose to do so. Or if you’re comfortable with someone, you may be just as happy to provide a counterpoint, either to challenge them or to offer another point of view. You’re not bound to one type of interaction and can relate to others in variable ways.<br>•   If you find yourself in a conflict with someone else, you’re likely to not be that invested in winning or surrendering. It probably depends on the person and the context. Again, you have the ability to adjust as things unfold, which is an asset in many circumstances.<br>•   On the occasion that you feel that someone has taken advantage of you in some way or taken offense for something, it is important for you to acknowledge what you experienced in order to move through it and integrate it into yourself. Since you tend to interact in non-threatening ways, owning your own feelings and thoughts will allow you to live more effectively from and with Reserve. <br>•   Living with Reserve includes adapting to stress in more effective ways as it arises so that you can foster a sense of stability in your own life. For most people, this is an ongoing practice.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   You are probably a kind and generous person who, at the same time, doesn’t feel responsible for the world. You let people live their lives as you live yours. This is exceptional in and of itself by virtue of the fact that many people are more concerned about how others live than they are themselves.<br>•   Nevertheless, the idea behind living with Reserve is learning new ways to operate from a place of security and well-being. So enhancing how you manage and regulate your own stress is essential to your further pursuit of exceptionality. <br>•   Whatever peccadillos you have, whatever ideas you’ve cemented about yourself and others over the course of your life, you have to be willing to review these and make changes where needed. This could pertain to any area of your life, be it spiritual, physical, emotional, or intellectual.<br>•   Learning how to digest the truths that will help you get to the next phase of your own development is something that you can only accomplish by doing it. This is worth saying because it takes great courage to admit where we can improve and where we have fallen short, but both are part of the journey forward.<br>•   Self-care is also part of this journey, so your optimism will be an aid all along the way. Whatever sense of meaning and purpose you have will be enhanced as you become even more integrated as a person and in your life. Tending to your physical health is key here as well."
var ALow="<h3>Agreeableness</h3>You feel like you get the most out of life by challenging the norms that others may more readily accept. You are passionate about your point of view and are willing to contest others if you feel an idea is worth standing up for.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   It’s not easy to go against the grain, and you are willing to do so. You have a desire to speak up for what you believe and a willingness to do so. You probably feel that to not do so would be to sacrifice part of who you are.<br>•   The question then is how many golden calves do you have and which ones are the most important? This is important to consider because you have to decide where you energy is best invested. Somethings are worth fighting for, and some aren’t.<br>•   Living with Reserve means knowing your own stress points, the things that get you out of balance. Learning how to manage these and anticipate your own needs in times of stress is key to operating from a place of comfort and stability. <br>•   Everyone has stressors, so getting to know them a little better will enable you to find an even more positive way forward in the company of others who want to live with greater Reserve.<br>•   Self-examination is part of most any process toward self-actualization, so embracing the process, even though it may be difficult at times, is worth it as you find resources you may not have known you have and navigate the growth that is often uncomfortable but valuable beyond measure.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Living into greater exceptionality is a great opportunity and challenge. People use superlatives like “great,” “awesome,” and “wonderful” frequently so that we may be immune to cases of actual exceptionality. That being said, living an exceptional life is not ultimately about what other people think of you but you live it for yourself. You, in fact, are the only one who can.<br>•   The leap you are invited to take forward is optimistic: you are valued and capable. Everything you need is inside of you. The challenge is what to do when you meet parts of yourself that want to rely on the old ways, the familiar. <br>•   Therefore, it’s important to keep in mind that just because something is familiar doesn’t mean it is effective. If familiarity were a measure of success, people who never venture out would be the hallmarks of society, but they’re typically not. People who are willing to look beyond their own limitations, internal and external, usually find something others do not and cannot know about.<br>•   So apply yourself to this journey of living with Reserve, a path that asks you to learn new ways to maintain a sense of stability through change and stress. Whatever your stressors are, they are you best and most reliable teachers. They will become your assets if you want them to. Only by being open to them can you become the person you’ve set out to be.<br>•   The degree to which you care for yourself along the way is also very important, particularly the little critic in your head. If you haven’t already, begin to intervene on the little critic. Say, “I’m going to give you the day off” and smile. Do it repeatedly if you need to. The little critic is not your ally. Sustain your efforts to move beyond that voice with bodily sustenance too, in the form of a good diet and exercise. These are the fuel for the change you seek."
var AVeryLow="<h3>Agreeableness</h3>Your own ideas are very dear to you, so you are likely to defend them to the death. Because you’re so invested in them, you also may find people who are equally insistent or who disagree with you as troublesome and therefore unsympathetic and/or uncomprehending of your point of view.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Living with Reserve increases your quality of life, so identifying the stressors that can increase or keep you in a stressed state is essential to learning how to live more fully with Reserve. <br>•   You seek perfection in the world around you, which is positive insofar as you strive for it yourself. This can also be a limitation when the same expectation is extended to others because everyone, in the simplest terms, is different. Just as you are not going to bend to others way of seeing, they are unlikely to bend to yours. That doesn’t mean some mutual exchange and growth cannot occur though.<br>•   If you shield yourself from other ways of thinking and seeing the world, you may be living an insulated life, which is not beneficial when it comes to living with Reserve. It has its benefits but will be hard on you in the long term. <br>•   Living with Reserve means learning how to deal with the stresses you face without creating more stress. If you feel defensive or notice yourself developing grudges towards people who don’t see the world as you do, that’s a lot of tied up energy that you are carrying with you. It’s very difficult to maintain stability through change if you are on the defensive much of the time. <br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Being exceptional means being in meaningful relationships with others. Your ability to integrate into groups and function in a wide range of interactions will increase your Reserve and allow you to operate from a place of abundance. <br>•   If you have difficulty doing this, you probably have an important area to pursue growth. Living with Reserve, or moving toward it, requires effortful behavior, being motivated to address areas that are not as strong as they can be. <br>•   If you feel defensive at times, or even often, it’s worth investigating where this comes from. You will not be able to live with Reserve in a meaningful and substantial way without doing so. This is very hopeful because many people have faced the same thing and come to find new purpose through such an exploration.<br>•   People have sought the support of counselors of various sorts, life coaches, cognitive therapy, and others. Whatever path you find, you will be able to build on the courage that it takes to face whatever it is that is inside you.<br>•   Maintaining your physical health alongside your emotional and mental health is important. This includes diet, exercise, and avoiding substances that put the body in a state of stress, particularly alcohol, smoking, and drugs."
var CVeryHigh="<h3>Conscientiousness</h3>You bring the highest level of focus and intensity that you can when directing yourself to the tasks at hand. You are a go-getter that leaves other go-getters in the dust. Your systematic approach to all that you do allows you to feel like you’re getting the absolute most of everything that you do.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   You really don’t have a low gear when it comes to accomplishing what you set out to do, and you don’t relent in your efforts. Being this fastidious in your approach means that you provide a thoroughness that few others can match.<br>•   Because you strive for such accuracy and perfection in all that you do, you probably have very high expectations for yourself. Without these, you probably would not have achieved what you have, so they have served you well for the most part.<br>•   When, however, your expectations of yourself become engorged, i.e. are no longer into proportion to what is reasonable to ask of yourself, you can begin to lose sight of the processes you are engaged in, more solely focused on the results.<br>•   This can be handicapping to a degree because perfectionism is often masking the desire to control that which can only be managed. Few results are entirely predictable, which can also be part of the fun of engaging with any task or process: it unfolds and is discovered in each moment.<br>•   This may not sound that wonderful to you—or it may—but it doesn’t change the fact that you have a sincere ability to track that which you want to accomplish, so the next task is making sure that it is serving you and not you it.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Being exceptional sounds wonderful, but the journey to it is simply hard. You know how to do things that are hard, so you have a leg up. Once that leg is up, moving at your rapid rate, in between steps is the need for self-reflection and assessment. <br>•   Living with Reserve asks you to pause and breathe so that you can see how the parts of your life and self are integrated. Go-getters like you don’t often have time for this or haven’t really practiced it, so it can be a steep learning curve. Maybe even an unsettling one. <br>•   Be that as it may, consider the possibility that you can be even more effective and content in your life if you learn more about living with Reserve. For you, this means looking at your life as a whole and seeing which parts have gotten care and attention and which parts haven’t. <br>•   This is not always fun, but it’s important. You already know what would happen to a business owner if they never took inventory. They wouldn’t know what they really had, nor would they know how to go forward. It’d be a mess.<br>•   As you do this and begin to slow down—just a little, to begin—your peripheral vision will widen and you may start to get glances of things you hadn’t seen before. At the very least, you will have the opportunity to make sure you are tending to your own health so that you will be able to marshal your resources as best you can as you delve into facing the parts of yourself that have kept you from achieving an exceptionality that you really want but didn’t have the resources for because you hadn’t been as clear about how to live with Reserve."
var CHigh="<h3>Conscientiousness</h3>In the simplest terms, you get things done. You take an organized, thoughtful approach to that which you apply yourself, and you are dedicated in your efforts. You don’t believe in cutting corners because you would rather cover all of your bases than wonder what was left undone.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5><br>•   You have an affinity for doing things the right way, for being investigative and following through with that which you have set out to do. This is a talent in a world in which many people struggle to finish what they start and are quick to congratulate average work.<br>•   Because you take a thoughtful approach to life and all that comes with it, you show yourself to be a person of integrity and grit, which are valued commodities among your peers and for yourself. <br>•   You are already on a solid path when it comes to living with Reserve because of these things, so the next phase is discovering where you might be able to fill out your personality and abilities so that you are even more effective as a person.<br>•   You may think, “That’s not possible!” but that’s the beauty of living with Reserve. Even highly motivated people have aspects of their lives that could be more balanced and less strained so that they are operating from a position of greater stability and assuredness, even in times of duress. <br>•   Living with Reserve is about just this.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   You wouldn’t be where you are in life if you weren’t as effective as you are at planning and strategizing how to tackle projects, tasks, and goals. Being exceptional taps into that because regulating your stress levels is essential to operating with Reserve.<br>•   Instead of anticipating what lies ahead in terms of the tasks you’ve laid out, you’re anticipating your own needs based on the stresses that arise and determining, at least in part, how to satisfy them ahead of time.<br>•   In other words, living with Reserve means looking within so that you can resolve whatever uncertainties arise in you as they occur. You’re probably very good at this, but applying it to yourself, not just in intellectual terms, but in terms of your physical, emotional, and spiritual self, may need more development.<br>•   Because you know how to get things done, you may have sacrificed aspects of these, for surely a variety of reasons. But living with Reserve is designed to allow you to reclaim them and function at a level you may not have known was possible or known how to put into practice.<br>•   In terms of physical health, your dedication may take a toll on your body. It’ll be important to evaluate that accurately so that you can be in the best physical health that you can. This means eating well (not fast) and doing at least moderate exercise. You’ll have to determine, with help perhaps, what to tend to in terms of the emotional and spiritual as this journey unfolds."
var CMedium="<h3>Conscientiousness</h3>You combine a relaxed approach to life with a sense of purpose for the things that are important to you. This means that you have direction without a need to control the process. You are organized enough to get things done, but you don’t pore over every detail along the way. This means that you’re capable of enjoying the process too.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Living with Reserve requires flexibility and discipline, and you have some of both. This puts you in a good position to operate from a place of Reserve to a greater degree. <br>•   Your flexibility and discipline will help you get a sense of where your greatest strides can be made because everyone has aspects of themselves that they can improve. The willingness to see these and the ability to follow through on changing them are the proverbial keys to the kingdom. <br>•   By honing in on the ones that hamper you more than others, you will make the most gains and probably find relief from things you may not even have known were nagging you or weighing you down. Stress can be subtle like that.<br>•   And that’s what this process is about: identifying the stressors that make it harder for your to maintain stability in times of change. Some of these may be obvious and some not so obvious. Whether it’s a feather or bag of lead, all weight that you carry adds up, especially if that feather is poking you. Darn feather!<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Nobody can make the needed changes but you. That is probably an empowering statement for you because you are able to adjust to life and may even enjoy doing so. Being exceptional means getting the most out of your flexibility and discipline because living a life that operates from abundance rather than deficit means living with less fear and more possibility, both of which reflect who you are.<br>•   Managing the uncertainties of life, while more natural to some than others, is something that most everyone can improve at. Living with Reserve means learning where you are inefficient in how you manage areas of your life, which in turn causes unnecessary stress. <br>•   Stress is a largely misunderstood concept in society. People act like all stress is equal, but it’s not. And each person experiences stress differently. So becoming exceptional is about knowing a deep way what makes you tick and learning how to anticipate your own needs and planning for them. You’re not becoming a fortune teller, per se, but through living with Reserve, will be better prepared to deal with whatever happens to you in life.<br>•   You will have a greater sense of optimism, a more honest and enjoyable sense of control about more aspects of your life, and will find more purpose and meaning in what you value, all of which contribute to your well-being and self-esteem.<br>•   Being part of a community is important to forging a life that lives from abundance. Having people to rely on in times of stress helps deal with the stress load itself and mitigates any isolation or loneliness that often accompanies stress. The same can be said for taking care of your body, particularly maintaining a routine of at least moderate exercise and supporting that with a balanced diet. Each supports the other, and all contribute to living an exceptional life."
var CLow="<h3>Conscientiousness</h3>You have a casual approach to life and all that comes with it. Life is to be enjoyed, not managed. As such, you are more interested in experiences than goals. You would rather wear life like a loose garment than get caught up in the details.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   Your zest for experiences is the touchstone of your life and one of your greatest assets. You live to ingest all that life has to offer and are not wary of what may lie around the bend. In fact, you often look forward to it, aware that what is possible is also quite exciting.<br>•   Wearing life like a loose garment gives you a lot of flexibility. Your sense of well-being is not tied to external results so much as it is to living in the moment. This works to your advantage in some regards but can also create some challenges when it comes to living with Reserve.<br>•   In order to maintain a life that prioritizes the moment above all else (or most else), you may also have to ignore or at least not give a great deal of attention to the long-term impact of some aspects of your life. Certainly, living for today has its merits and benefits, and probably seems more realistic/manageable, but living with Reserve looks to help you move your life toward greater exceptionality.<br>•   This means acknowledging some of the stresses of the future that aren’t necessarily fun to look at or plan for. By doing so, however, your overall stress will actually lessen as you get more comfortable managing this aspect of life. That is what living with Reserve is all about.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Part of the efficient regulation of stress is learning how to better manage uncertainty. You may actually prefer uncertainty in some regards because the mystery, for you, may be invigorating. In terms of growing into your own exceptionality, though, resolving uncertainties in your life is key to living with Reserve. <br>•   Not all things are to be resolved, or anything like that, especially since you really enjoy the surprises of living each day. But whether you’re fully aware of it or not, there are uncertainties in your life that wear on you, so this process is going to help you learn how to better embrace them while not sacrificing who you are. <br>•   Training your brain to respond to challenges in new and reassuring ways can give you an even more encompassing sense of freedom. When undergirded with responsibility for your long-term well-being, you will be even more able to spread your wings. <br>•   Everyone has to deal with life’s limitations to some degree, and doing so actually empowers you because once you acknowledge where there are hindrances or roadblocks, you can create a path that more fully fits you.<br>•   Taking care of your health is essential to reducing stress and living with Reserve. This could be mentally and emotionally, but it also has to do with your spiritual and physical lives. It’s important to continue to cultivate whatever feeds your spirit in a sustaining way. The same is true for your physical health, including eating foods that nourish your body so that you can better feed your soul. Adding exercise to this only bolsters your Reserve further."
var CVeryLow="<h3>Conscientiousness</h3>You really like following your own path, doing things your own way. The last thing you want to do is get caught up in the minutiae of life because you live life freely and without restraint. You don’t get stuck in the details of life and rarely wonder what might’ve been because you’re too busy living.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   You don’t stress out about things because you really don’t concern yourself with things that don’t matter to you. This is in some ways admirable because your life is mostly about what is important you. It’s not about what’s important to everyone else.<br>•   Living with Reserve means not operating under too much stress because when stress begins to build or become overloaded, your ability to function well decreases. Since you understand that it’s important to do what matters to you, you may also see the value in living life even more freely than you are in order to get the most out it.<br>•   Living with Reserve can help you do this by giving you a better understanding of how to be your best self, how to live freely and fully as you want to. This may require doing a few things that you might not previously have considered, but if it leads you to more choices and toward the life you’ve been pursuing, it may be worth it.<br>•   Pursuing this life is not necessarily going to be easy though, but the chances are you are up for the task because while you may not be interested in following the herd, you probably trust your gut and may see this as an opportunity to do something pretty cool.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   The path to exceptionality is different for everyone, so this plays to your strengths. You like to find your own way and be your own person. There are also aspects of this process that require some change. The degree to which you embrace the need for change and follow through with it so that you can live with greater Reserve will likely determine what you make of this process. Many people don’t deal with it well and therefore struggle when faced with it.<br>•   You have the chance to learn how to better regulate your response to situations that might otherwise create a sense of uncertainty in you. Everyone encounters this, so it’s more about how to deal with uncertainty as it arises so that it doesn’t overwhelm or overtax you. You may like that idea as someone who has a penchant for keeping things loose.<br>•   Living with Reserve also asks that you develop along different lines, particularly in terms of engaging with different social groups with whom you share a sense of community. You can participate in these in a variety of manners. You may already have some of this, so you’ll be building on that, as you are encouraged to explore new ways in which you can bring your assets to groups of which you’d like to be a part. Having this type of support is necessary in times of stress and provides you relief and comfort, even if you don’t see yourself as needing much of this.<br>•   Other aspects that contribute to moving toward even greater exceptionality in your life are attention to your physical health and hygiene. Diet, exercise, and personal habits impact your overall ability to manage stress and function more freely and fluidly in life. Taking care of your body is necessary for living exceptionally."
var OVeryHigh="<h3>Openness to Experience</h3>You cannot imagine life without an ever-widening range of aesthetic encounters, be it through art, ideas, or nature. You live for this type of engagement and find that such endeavors feed your life in ways that few, if any, other things can. <br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   You are fortunate to be able to feed yourself through a variety of media that are stimulating and nourishing. The pursuit of a life lived in greater Reserve is made easier when you know what gives your world a sense of meaning and purpose, which you clearly do. <br>•   Living with Reserve is hard when life is out of balance, when the physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional are not each given due attention and care. The question for you, then, is where do you need to apply yourself in a more direct manner in regard to these. <br>•   Aesthetic engagement certainly engages your spiritual side and probably your emotions, and it may even ignite some aspects of your intellect. But all of these, plus your physical body/self, have different parts and perspectives to them. Being willing and able to look deeper into where you can bring more of yourself out, to what in yourself needs greater development, will be key to living with Reserve.<br>•   If you are neglecting the physical care that is necessary, which is possible, that may be a good place to start. Diet and exercise are absolutely essential to living with Reserve. Since you value the imagination so highly, you may take your health and body for granted. You may not, but tending to it will enhance the other aspects of your well-being.<br>•   If your pursuits are consumed by a heart for the aesthetic experience, which again is largely a good thing, you might also need to look at what aspects of your life are being given less attention, perhaps even neglected. Stress can accumulate in these areas without you knowing it or without you thinking it’s affecting you. It does affect you, though, so bringing these things into the light will help you move toward an even steadier sense of self.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   You have exceptionality in your life already, so taking that and applying to other aspects of your life will be an important touchstone for you. Translating your love of beauty as captured in art and nature, or in ideas, into other parts of your life will be helpful to becoming a more fully integrated person.<br>•   You likely tilt the scale when it comes to imaginative interests, so growing in how you engage with some of the practical parts of life will, though it may be undesirable at first, allow you to create more stability in your life. This is what living with Reserve is largely about. <br>•   That’s not to say that you have to neglect your passions: quite the opposite, in fact. Living with Reserve is about reducing uncertainty in your life in order to operate from a greater homeostasis, i.e. a much-reduced stress quotient. Stress adds up in little and big ways, so whatever ways you can invest some time in taking care of all parts of your life, the better shape you are going to be in.<br>•   Living with Reserve is designed to help your brain regulate and resolve the uncertainties you face in your life without getting too far out of whack. Most people find that to be an attractive notion, and less cumulative stress means having more energy for the pursuits you most love. Woohoo!<br>•   So taking stock of your life may be the most advantageous and life-giving thing you can do. Looking at the physical, spiritual, intellectual, and emotional parts of oneself is where the answers usually are, even when they’re hard to look at. But what would life be without these challenges? A dead end, maybe potential regret, and just not what it can be!"
var OHigh="<h3>Openness to Experience</h3>The openness you bring to your everyday life keeps you inspired and growing. You breathe in the world as best you can each day and are grateful for the many ways in which it fills your lungs. You have a natural affinity for imaginative pursuits and people, especially when they—the people and/or the ideas—are enigmatic or curious in some way.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   The saying “The world is your oyster” can be applied a number of ways and contexts, but for you it may be quite literal. You see beauty in much of what you encounter and have an openness that gives your life a vastness and sense of possibility that is life-giving.<br>•   You may also, because of this openness, at times feel disappointment with a world that doesn’t respond in kind, that is provincial or near-sighted or bogged down with facts and answers. <br>•   Whatever your stressors are, they likely impact you in very visceral ways, and you probably take them very seriously. You may even want others to see the world through the lens you do, and some surely do. <br>•   Learning about how to deal with these stressors in effective ways is going to be important to living with Reserve because your life has an optimism to it that you want to maintain and even grow. Stress reduces your ability to do this, and pretty much everyone has little and big stresses that accumulate in their lives.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Drawing on your sense of wonder about the world you engage with every day is key to your ability to consistently live from a place of abundance. When that sense of wonder gets tinged by less savory feelings or experiences, doing what you can to honor your feelings at that moment, or sometime thereafter, will allow you to feel that you are honoring yourself.<br>•   Acknowledging these feelings in a healthy way is essential to healing yourself all along the way. Otherwise, your openness could turn into a kind of judgment upon others or a sense of superiority that isn’t you and won’t serve you.<br>•   This happens to all kinds of personality types, but for you it’s something to be aware of because you love the imaginative world and don’t want to do anything to detract from what it is for you. That means owning all of who you are because you are part of the imaginative world you connect to. Your experience of it is what gives it meaning.<br>•   This type of personal encounter cannot be tarnished by anyone else unless allowed to. Your sense of self, and how you manage and care for it, is key to living with Reserve. You may be a “dreamer” or a “romantic” or whatever labels people throw your way, but your indulgence is not in such things: it’s in the intimacy of your own experiences and what they mean to you.<br>•   So do the footwork to ensure that your sense of self is grounded. This will surely require self-examination so that you can see where cracks have developed in your life and expose them to the same light you do every day. Tending to your physical health is also an indispensable part of this process. Your body can only take your mind and soul to the lengths that you empower it to."
var OMedium="<h3>Openness to Experience</h3>You like exploration and the familiar. You’re in many ways unbounded, though you very much like things that have given you comfort for much of your life. Familiarity and tradition augment the quality of your life as much as seeing new works of art of engaging with interesting people and ideas.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   You are a healthy blend of the old and new. This is especially helpful in life because having a sense of where things come, their history, allows you to make sense of how the pieces fit together. The exciting part for you is also that fresh outcomes and possibilities are welcome along the way. You like predictability, but you’re not tied to it.<br>•   This fits in with Reserve because learning how to live with greater Reserve means developing a more integrated life so that uncertainty doesn’t have as much as an impact on you, large or small.<br>•   You may feel that you deal pretty well with uncertainty, and you may, but the purpose of this process is to identify areas of your life that are not as developed as others, the parts of you that absorb more stress than others. <br>•   These areas create the load that affects your ability to deal with stress and resolve uncertainty with greater efficiency. That’s not to say that anyone will be able to avoid uncertainty, just that is won’t have as much power to destabilize your life.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   If you like new adventures and learn from that which has come before you, you have two of the key components of living out of your own exceptionality already in hand. Being exceptional, in part, means understanding where you’ve come from and being able to take a moment to visualize where you can go.<br>•   Your ability to leverage both of these at your highest levels inform how exceptional your life can become. This also requires quite a bit of legwork, of work on the ground so to speak. It means taking a good look at the parts of your life that are less and more effective and determining what changes need to be made.<br>•   Some of these changes you will probably be excited about and others you may be hesitant to incorporate. It’s not important what your initial reaction is to these parts of yourself as it is what you do in the long-term. The reality is that real change, change that can sustain your life, tends to happen gradually over time so that it can become a real part of you.<br>•   Living with Reserve is therefore not done on the fly. Learning more about maintaining stability through times of change means growing in how you approach the different parts of yourself: the mental, the emotional, the physical, and the spiritual.<br>•   Being able and willing to engage each of these aspects of yourself will enable you to become even more adaptable to the world around you while maintaining the core of who you are. Continuing to take the courage required to do this is necessary. And you absolutely have the ability to do it.<br>•   Taking care of yourself physically along the way will be key as well. All parts of you as a person are affected at the most fundamental level by how you treat your body. It affects emotions, thoughts, and your sense of your spiritual connectedness to life around you. Investing in exercise and good dietary habits have greater ramifications and benefits that much of society acknowledges, and boosting this self-care is a wonderfully supportive thing for you to do for yourself."
var OLow="<h3>Openness to Experience</h3>You look to that which is familiar as your greatest source of strength. You believe that consistency provides security and helps build a good life. If ideas, beliefs, or practices have worked for others for a long time, you find comfort in that and look to extend that sense of safety to others.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   You look to carry on the traditions that have been passed down to you as they give you a sense of meaning and purpose in your life. This contributes to your own ability to operate from a place of Reserve because you don’t put others or yourself in a position to have to worry about the stresses of the unfamiliar.<br>•   Living with Reserve looks to bolster your ability to deal with the unfamiliar or uncertainty as it rears its head. Because you don’t like, and may even recoil from the unfamiliar, this may be a growing edge for you. <br>•   In truth, few people embrace newness in every area of their lives. People like stability. At the same time, encouraging what you’ve learned with additional ways to enhance your quality of life is likely a worthwhile endeavor. Living with Reserve looks to help you do this.<br>•   Because you value a sense of certainty in your life, you may not like some ways in which this process will challenge you. That’s okay too. The key is to be willing to suspend judgment on learning how to better live with Reserve so that you can make up your own mind from a position of informed confidence.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Your sense of routine and order are wonderful building blocks as you live into your exceptionality. These work for a reason. Utilizing these as you incorporate new items into your routine and grow as a person will be indispensable.<br>•   One of the goals of living with Reserve is to live an integrated life: personally, socially, in terms of physical and mental health. Doing this means learning and unlearning. This is the case because human beings are social creatures and acquire behaviors through their life experiences. Some of these increase the quality of life and others are just placeholders till something better comes along.<br>•   Getting an even better handle on what increases quality of life and what really is a placeholder is a gamechanger because it means being able to face whatever challenges come your way with a certain constancy and steadfastness.<br>•   Physical health is very much a part of this process. If you take care of yourself, from sleep amount and quality to diet and exercise, you should be in good shape, pardon the pun. If there are aspects you can improve, you can simply look at how they could fit into your routine.<br>•   Social integration is also key to living with Reserve. Making the effort to engage in a wide variety of social interactions creates a sense of community that is very reliable and provides relief in times of stress. And that’s the things about stress: it can show up in large and small ways without any notice. So the more you have in place ahead of time, the better. But as someone who believes in the tried and true, you probably understand this and are good at putting it into practice."
var OVeryLow="<h3>Openness to Experience</h3>If you haven’t done it or seen in before, it is probably not on your radar. You’re the type of person who knows what works and what can be done because you have firsthand experience of it. As far as you’re concerned, that’s all that matters and all that there is because at the end of the day, the things that people know work will outlast almost all others.<br><br><h5>Implications for Living with Reserve</h5>•   You have a sense of confidence about what the possibilities. You thrive in situations where you can bring your expertise and knowledge to bear. Applying your ability to do this will help you grow into living with greater Reserve because the people have been invested in increasing the quality of their lives for a long time.<br>•   This may also mean be exposed to ideas and approaches that though grounded in age-old practices may in some ways be new to you. If this turns out to be true, it will be helpful to try to understand the bigger picture of what you’re being called to do.<br>•   You’re very capable of looking at how things fit together with an eye to how things will ultimately work out, so using this practical approach will help you be open to what is truly required to live with Reserve. You may at times find yourself not seeing the merit of parts of the process or not wanting to engage with them if they are uncomfortable to you, but giving yourself permission to trust the process is essential too.<br>•   You already know the importance of trusting the process because that is how you’ve come to trust the world around you: you were exposed to a certain way of doing things, saw that it worked, and came to trust it. The same things applies to living with Reserve. You will be asked to rely on your strengths and challenge aspects of your way of doing things so that you can have a more developed and rewarding life.<br><br><h5>Being Exceptional</h5>•   Living into a more exceptional way of life provides an even greater sense of control over your well-being and sense of purpose. That is one of the chief goals of living with Reserve. <br>•   This means learning to better regulate whatever uncertainties life brings, and there are some doozies out there. So it makes sense that you, as a pragmatic person, would want to optimize your ability to regulate and reduce stress as uncertainties present themselves in your life.<br>•   Efficient regulation of stress, which is part of establishing a very solid Reserve, requires learning how to better anticipate and respond to situations that cause stress before they do. Developing healthy responses to the variety of scenarios that can crop up means the need to grow as a person.<br>•   Most everyone has blind spots in their lives, things they haven’t wanted to look at and may have hoped to improve but haven’t gotten to yet. Living with reserve asks you to do this. This means giving the brain more information about how to resolve uncertainty that you encounter or that you may have put aside.<br>•   The manners in which you take care of yourself emotionally and spiritually are as important as physically and intellectually. Maintaining stability through change at a high level means making the most out of all parts of your life and yourself. If you neglect, for example, your diet, the body will be affected, which in turn will affect your mind and your emotions. If you have some emotional wounds or healing to do, that needs to be tended to or your spirit may be affected in its ability to soar. It’s all connected, and you likely get that. So go for it!<br>"
var ConcernsVeryLow="<h3>Life Concerns</h3>• Most of these concerns—from relationship problems to job security to fear of a natural disaster or the death of a loved one—affect people to some degree, so if you’re not experiencing concern about these at all, that’s not healthy either—it may even be a key indication that you are not in touch with what is happening in your life.<br>•   Seeing how others deal with these types of things—be it, for example, fear of a natural disaster, health concerns, sex-related problems, or job worries—can be a gauge, a guide of sorts, in determining how healthily you are dealing with these things. So ask others about what they’re experiencing regarding these types of concerns and listen.<br>•   Doing some journaling may help uncover reasons that you are blocked from experiencing the concern that comes with some of these. People develop a variety of defense mechanisms over the course of their lives, so it’s common to have these.<br>•  However you go about uncovering what’s keeping you from experiencing some sense of emotion/worry about these things, once you’ve done so, it’ll be important to find a healthy way to begin to process and deal with them. Therapy might be helpful, as might engaging in mind-body-spirit activities that help people integrate themselves. These include mindfulness exercises, yoga, and meditation.<br>"
var ConcernsLow="<h3>Life Concerns</h3>• If you typically feel no worry when it comes to job security, relationship troubles, the death of a loved one, or health problems, that in itself is something to be concerned about. People experience worry in regard to these for a reason, including sex-related problems and fear of a natural disaster.<br>• Your lack of worry regarding these may be an indication that you maintain a sense of stability or order by ignoring things like this because they can be hard to deal with. Or you may know at some level that you’re not prepared to or haven’t learned how to deal with them.<br>•    Because these concerns should elicit a real response from someone experiencing them, you need to move yourself in that direction to get the most out of your life, to live with reserve. Discussing it with someone who knows you well may be helpful or illuminating. It’s not by accident that you’ve shut off this part of yourself, so begin exploring.<br>•    As you discover truths about your life and your real concerns, they may be difficult to swallow at first or you may even feel that they are uninvited guests. You’ve probably kept them at bay for a reason. Doing simple things to reconnect to yourself will help you manage and integrate whatever feelings you encounter along the way. You might consider engaging in meditation exercises or some type of yoga. Even taking time to relax the whole body one part at time can greatly help you not get overtaxed as you work toward a more whole and healthy reserve.<br>"
var ConcernsMedium="<h3>Life Concerns</h3>• You’re right where you need to be in regard to the types of life concerns that really affect people (job security, relationship problems, fear of a natural disaster, health and sex-related problems, and the death of a loved one). You deal with them in healthy ways as they arise and don’t allow them to get too big to handle.<br>• Continue to move forward in the manner that you have, taking care of yourself in whatever ways you need to.<br>•    If others are sharing similar concerns, your stability may be a support to them. Maintaining an awareness of yourself and others helps you keep perspective.<br>•   Whatever you do to keep your sense of perspective and to live with reserve regarding these types of concerns, keep doing it. You’re managing well, which is a good sign.<br>"
var ConcernsHigh="<h3>Life Concerns</h3>• Knowing your stressors is helpful, so you’re on the right track. If they accumulate though, as they’ve done here for you, it can be difficult to live to your fullest because managing the stresses of your life is essential to functioning at a higher level. This is particularly in regard to the stress of job security, relationship problems, the death of a loved one, fear of a natural disaster, health problems, and sex-related matters.<br>•   You have a number of major areas that cause you worry, so you are carrying this weight with you right now. But you also have the ability to intervene so that you can operate in a more relaxed state.<br>• Several types of intervention can help you immediately move into a place of greater security. You might try doing something you find relaxing. Deep breathing can be very helpful, for instance.<br>•   If you like to exercise, this can also be very helpful. Yoga and meditation may also be beneficial as you reconnect with your body through breath. Part of the stress occurs because you get disconnected from yourself. These can help you reconnect.<br>"
var ConcernsVeryHigh="<h3>Life Concerns</h3>• You are expending a lot of energy when it comes to life concerns, which can really take a toll on you and your ability to live with reserve. These concerns include job security concerns, relationship problems, the death of a loved one, fear or a natural disaster, health problems, and sex-related matters.<br>• It’s natural to have some anxiety about such things, but to be high in several of them means that you are pushing your system to its limits, making it harder to deal with even day-to-day stresses.<br>•   It’s important to remember that most of these problems are not imminent threats on your well-being, so taking gradual steps to address the causes of your fears is part of the process. You might try talking to someone you trust about one or two of them, just to get them out in the open. Sometimes, just having worries rattle around in your head can cause them to be even more overwhelming.<br>•  In order to move toward your optimum, you might try some immediate techniques that help move you toward a less stressed state. This might include doing some journaling to help you clarify what you are feeling and why.<br>"

var ReconnectVeryLow="<h3>Conflict Resolution - Reconnection</h3>• You are not good at reconnecting with people when there has been a fracture in the relationship.<br>•   Whether it’s difficult for you to do or you don’t notice the problem to begin with, you are hampered by your inability to identify how and when to make amends.<br>•    You may take yourself too seriously, thinking that whatever was done cannot be undone. However, most people are willing to forgive or work toward some sense of harmony if the other party is willing to be honest and open. The possibilities are endless when relationships are approached with these two things.<br>•    However uncomfortable, being more open and honest are vital to living a life with reserve. Relationships are, by definition, hard, so investing in getting better at communication, especially when things go off course, will be a big relief and offers you many more options in your life. You don’t have to hide from this aspect of relationships, for one. You’re likely doing this in pursuit of your own exceptionality.<br>"
var ReconnectLow="<h3>Conflict Resolution - Reconnection</h3>• You’d prefer to not deal directly with whatever problems arise in your relationships with others.<br>•  Generally speaking, you don’t really know how or don’t want to reconnect with people who you’ve experienced any difficulty with. You’d rather not face these hurdles head-on.<br>•  Living the best life you can means learning how to do this better. People are absolutely part of living a good life, so better communication means less stress and greater satisfaction from those relationships.<br>•  Whatever barriers you face in this regard, it’s worth finding your way through it. Taking time to journal about your concerns and feelings could be a helpful tool in identifying what blocks you from being willing to discuss these types of things with those in your life.<br>"
var ReconnectMedium="<h3>Conflict Resolution - Reconnection</h3>•  Your desire to mend fractures in your relationships with others varies. Sometimes you want to reconnect quickly, and at other times, you may not notice a need to or be concerned with reconnecting at all.<br>•    With some people, you’re happy to discuss things openly, and with others, you’d rather not. Instead, you prefer to just forward with things as they are, maybe assuming things will be okay or work themselves out over time.<br>•  Having a sense of humor with those you are close to can be very helpful when mending aspects of the relationship. If you don’t take yourself too seriously—assuming it’s okay not to in the given context—the others involved will have the same opportunity. This can create a window for healing.<br>•    Also, knowing when and how to mend fences with people in your life is essential to living with reserve. Different people respond to different types of engagement. That being said, when you do want to reconnect, sincerity is usually a reliable and safe approach. People want to know that they are cared for, regardless of what else unfolds in the relationship, be it friendship or other types of relationships.<br>"
var ReconnectHigh="<h3>Conflict Resolution - Reconnection</h3>•    You are good at finding ways to bridge the troubled waters of your relationships. You, generally, don’t like for hurt to go unaddressed.<br>•   You’d prefer to speak openly with people in your life that, for whatever reason, you have gotten disconnected from, or they from you. You’re not really a fan of just waiting to see what happens.<br>• Keep up the good work on this. Some people are better at bridging the gaps in relationships than others.<br>•   Taking a moment to list what you are grateful for about your relationships may also be beneficial to your sense of self because it’s important to value what you’re good at.<br>"
var ReconnectVeryHigh="<h3>Conflict Resolution - Reconnection</h3>•    You have a wonderful ability to reconnect with people when a fissure in the relationship occurs.<br>•   You are willing to discuss things with them immediately and clear the air, giving you both the chance to find your way forward in the relationship, in whatever capacities fit your needs.<br>• You may even use humor as part of the rebuilding process, which is beneficial in a number of ways.

var AffectionVeryLow="<h3>Affection</h3>• You don’t really express your feelings to others, even those close to you. You prefer to keep things to yourself, even when you know that it’s harmful to do so.<br>•   You may like the idea of sharing your life with others, but you haven’t yet learned how to do so. There are probably good people in your life that you can share yourself with, but until you take the risk necessary, become more willing to be vulnerable, you won’t know how rewarding and fulfilling such things can be.<br>•   It’s hard for a lot of people to be vulnerable, so picking safe people with which to explore this is very important. Once you’ve identified someone to open up to, keep it simple. You don’t have to discuss the most complex things you’re toiling with. Just start with something in daily life that’s a little hard to deal with, and go from there.<br>•   Journaling can be very helpful as you develop your ability to identify and communicate your feelings with others. Part of this process is practice, practice at expressing what you’re really feeling and thinking. Everyone develops the ability to do this at different speeds and levels. You may also find mindfulness or relaxation exercises helpful in this regard. They will help you maintain a sense of security as you explore new parts of yourself.<br>"

You are hesitant to invite them into your inner world, the good and the bad.<br>•   You have people who you can rely upon, but for whatever reasons, you don’t like to. Perhaps your sense of independence or self-reliance gets in the way.<br>•   Inviting people into the difficulties of life, in fact, shows great independence and strength of spirit because admitting that life is hard is fundamental to living and having a better life.<br>•   If you find yourself uncomfortable letting others in, perhaps doing simple things to connect with yourself will help. Often times, writing about what you are feeling can help clarify things so that when you discuss them with someone else, it’s not as new to you. Taking time to consciously relax, be that through breathing exercises or some form of meditation, can also be very helpful in reducing stress and regaining a sense of control over things.<br>"
var AffectionMedium="<h3>Affection</h3>•  You care about those in your life, and you share yourself with them some of the time. You feel good about being honest about the troubles that you experience, but you may be guarded in exploring them with others to some degree.<br>•   You have people in your life who you can rely upon, which is reassuring. You try to have regular conversations with them about things of substance in your life, but it’s hard to do sometimes. This may be a time issue or because it’s difficult for you at times to find ways into more meaningful discussions.<br>•   Continuing to take conscious steps to let yourself be known to the people who want to know you will enhance the quality of your life. Just telling them one real thing that is going on in your life when you visit with them invites them into something meaningful.<br>•   Tending to your own sense of self and sense of comfort enables you to communicate as well. There are simple ways to bring ease into your own life, such as journaling on a regular basis or participating in a form of meditation that best fits you. This could be found in a morning walk, sitting outside, traditional meditation, or yoga. Whatever works for you.<br>"

Your ability to share the challenges you face in life with them is essential to the quality of your life.<br>•   You have a web of relationships that support you and give you others to support. Having meaningful exchanges is part of your life, is something that you value. You appreciate affection and can give it too.<br>•   You are fortunate to function in a way that has depth. There is no substitute for this in life. You are also able to have a good time, which is wonderful and necessary.<br>•   Continue doing the things that have made you successful in this regard, including self-care. Living with exceptionality means taking care of you on a daily basis. That may mean doing simple things you enjoy or taking time to relax. Usually tending to your physical health is a key part of this.<br>"
var AffectionVeryHigh="<h3>Affection</h3>•    Your willingness to express your feelings and thoughts, the parts of who you really are, with those close to you creates intimacy in your life. It helps foster a mutuality that cannot be achieved in any other way or regard.<br>•   Your vulnerability is a great source of strength and gives your life meaning. You have chosen to be connected to others, which gives your life substance. You are able to both give and receive affection.<br>•   You are a relational person, someone who understands that one’s life is measured by the quality of one’s relationships. Keep up the good work.<br>•   Maintaining what nourishes you is also important in this. Taking care of your body, through exercise and nutrition, as well as finding ways to connect with yourself in meditation or mindfulness exercises help sustain the good life you lead. Doing fun things, as you like doing, is part of this self-care too. Way to go!<br>"

var SensualityVeryLow="<h3>Ability to Enjoy the Physical</h3>•    If you don’t notice anything significant about the amazing world you are walking around in—all of the sensory wonder and beauty that it offers—you are missing out on an important part of life and a key element of living with reserve.<br>•  There’s a big world out there to enjoy and you are made of the same stuff it is. Finding a connection to it means finding a connection to yourself. This is essential to a vibrant and fulfilling life.<br>•    Make engaging with the natural world part of your life, something that you intentionally do. You may not yet have discovered what you stimulates you in this regard, but begin trying things. It can start with something as simple as breathing in the smells of a restaurant as you walk in the door or stopping to literally smell a rose that you see. It doesn’t have to be a metaphor.<br>•   Don’t let the sensory world pass you by. Living with reserve means integrating the physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional. Ignoring one of these parts means living part of a life. You might even list some things you could do to venture out, be it going to a flower garden or simply taking a walk outside of your workplace or home. Then pay attention and note what you are experiencing firsthand.<br>"
var SensualityLow="<h3>Ability to Enjoy the Physical</h3>•    The five senses—see, touch, taste, smell, and hear—are integral to being human and essential to living a full life. Since you are not very connected to these in your daily life, you may not be getting all that you could out of your life.<br>•  Not getting pleasure out of the physical world often means living in one’s mind, which is only part of who you are. Even if you have momentary awareness of joys the physical world presents, having a more ongoing connection can provide sustenance that nothing else can.<br>•   Begin by doing simple things that fit into your daily life. Sniff, watch, and listen, to start with. Part of connecting to the wonder of the physical world is simply choosing to do so amid the hurly-burly of life.<br>•  Once you start hearing, seeing, and smelling the world around you, you will likely feel more connected to the world in which you participate. The distance between you and life around you will dissipate, which creates the sense of being part of a larger whole. You can have this, and it will help you live a more optimum life in general.<br>"
var SensualityMedium="<h3>Ability to Enjoy the Physical</h3>• You find some pleasure in your experience of the sensory world, stronger at some times than others.<br>•    You my not go looking for ways to enjoy pure physical sensations but you appreciate them when they occur.<br>•  Finding regular ways to connect with the physical world you live in and all of its majesty may heighten your experience of life in general. Listening to the wind or rain are simple ways to be reminded of a bigger world of which you are a part.<br>•    The next time you are eating something you really enjoy, you might take an extra moment or two to inhale its goodness, to really connect to what you love about it. These sensory experiences are important to your well-being and living with reserve.<br>"
var SensualityHigh="<h3>Ability to Enjoy the Physical</h3>•   Being able to find joy in the pleasure of your five senses is a gift in your life.<br>• You have a broad experience of the world around you, thanks to your sensitivity to it.<br>• Continue enjoying the wonderland of your senses.<br>•   Taking note of what you’re experiencing sensorially can be an encouraging affirmation of who you are.<br>"
var SensualityVeryHigh="<h3>Ability to Enjoy the Physical</h3>•   You do an excellent job imbibing on the physical world around you and how it engages your senses.<br>•  Because you are able to open up to your connectedness to your senses, you have access to the fulness of the world in which you live.<br>•   You get such pleasure out of such simple engagements, keep it up.<br>•  Maintaining your connection to the sights and sounds of the world around you keeps you connected to yourself. Continue doing what you’re doing.<br>"

var GaslightVeryLow="<h3>•Conflict Resolution - Passiveness</h3>•  You are a supportive person who does their part to show in your relationships. You take responsibility for your part in the relationship and look to work with the other person in whatever ways that you can to build the relationship.<br>•   You want to have healthy relationships with others, so you do what you can to cultivate behaviors that enable this.<br>•    Keep up the good work. You have a lot to offer those with whom you spend time and care about. You are on the path to living your optimum life because of how you treat others.<br>"
var GaslightLow="<h3>•Conflict Resolution - Passiveness</h3>•  You tend to take a kind and compassionate approach to others.<br>•  You’re not the type of person to take advantage of others so that you’ll feel good about yourself. You, instead, treat people with dignity and respect, hoping that they will treat you the same way.<br>•  Because you live this way, you have a greater opportunity to live into your own exceptionality, especially since relationships are central to an exceptional life.<br>"
var GaslightMedium="<h3>•Conflict Resolution - Passiveness</h3>•   While you don’t do it all the time, you have the ability (and sometimes tendency) to put the responsibility for the relationship on the other person. You may not be aware that you are doing it, or you may only do it because you don’t know how else to function at times, but it’s destructive either way.<br>• This is problematic because even in limited instances, making the other party feel like they are responsible for the health of the relationship is unfair and manipulative. Both parties are responsible for the life of the relationship in all its aspects.<br>•  It’s time, therefore, to learn how to share in the responsibilities of the relationship. You likely do this in some regards, but incorporating it into all components of the relationship will help you live into the exceptionality you desire.<br>•   The key to changing is availing yourself of the resources that are available to you, including counseling and training in how to better communicate and respond to the needs of others. You have some ability to do this, so you will be building on this.<br>"
var GaslightHigh="<h3>•Conflict Resolution - Passiveness</h3>• Part of the way you operate, especially with people you’re close to, is to put all responsibility for the relationship on the other person. This means that you are more interested in maintaining a position of authority in the relationship than you are in figuring out how to work through any difficulties.<br>•  You also likely ignore whatever disagreements that occur and wait for the other person approach you. This is not helpful in resolving conflict and living with reserve. This approach needlessly puts stress on you and them.<br>•  It’s time to intervene on this type of manipulative behavior. No one deserves to be on the receiving end of it, and you probably don’t want to continue it if it means that you cannot achieve an exceptional life. How you treat people is at the core of this.<br>•   In order to intervene, you will likely need some assistance. Learning new behaviors and ways to communicate are essential, so you’ll probably require guidance from someone who has experience with this. A life coach may be helpful, as will taking positive steps each day to choose to relate to others differently.<br>"
var GaslightVeryHigh="<h3>•Conflict Resolution - Passiveness</h3>• Your approach to relationships is extremely caustic to them and you. For you, being in relationship with someone else is about maintaining power, not about sharing in that power balance that is part of any healthy relationship.<br>•    Your modus operandi is to sow doubt in the other person’s perception of reality so that you can gain control over them. This can include making them question their memory of things, employing persistent denial of the facts, and lying. There is nothing good about this approach to people. It harms them and you.<br>• First, this has to stop, and it likely won’t be easy. If you want to live a truly fulfilling life, you will need to begin to learn how to relate to people in a new way, a more vulnerable way. This may sound scary, but without this, your life will have a huge void in it.<br>• You may need to seek out professional guidance and support. Therapists are trained to help you unlearn old behaviors so that you can become the person you really want to be. You’ve likely been in this rut for a while, so it makes sense that you’ll need help climbing out of it.<br>"

Your ability to share the challenges you face in life with them is essential to the quality of your life.<br>•    You have a web of relationships that support you and give you others to support. Having meaningful exchanges is part of your life, is something that you value. You appreciate affection and can give it too.<br>•  You are fortunate to function in a way that has depth. There is no substitute for this in life. You are also able to have a good time, which is wonderful and necessary.<br>•   Continue doing the things that have made you successful in this regard, including self-care. Living with exceptionality means taking care of you on a daily basis. That may mean doing simple things you enjoy or taking time to relax. Usually tending to your physical health is a key part of this.<br>"
var AffectionVeryHigh="<h3>Affection</h3>•    Your willingness to express your feelings and thoughts, the parts of who you really are, with those close to you creates intimacy in your life. It helps foster a mutuality that cannot be achieved in any other way or regard.<br>•    Your vulnerability is a great source of strength and gives your life meaning. You have chosen to be connected to others, which gives your life substance. You are able to both give and receive affection.<br>• You are a relational person, someone who understands that one’s life is measured by the quality of one’s relationships. Keep up the good work.<br>• Maintaining what nourishes you is also important in this. Taking care of your body, through exercise and nutrition, as well as finding ways to connect with yourself in meditation or mindfulness exercises help sustain the good life you lead. Doing fun things, as you like doing, is part of this self-care too. Way to go!<br>"

var RationalDecisionsMain="<h3>Relational Decision</h3>•    You prefer to gather as much information you can when making a decision. You like to have the evidence and weigh the relevant facts.<br>•   Part of this process includes making sense of how the choices before you resonate with your own values and how you decision might impact others and what they value.<br>"
var ConsensusDecisionsMain="<h3>Consensus Decision</h3>•   When making a decision, you do an excellent job of getting input from multiple sources. You like to get feel that multiple voices are part of the process.<br>• You are also aware that getting input from stakeholders will help ensure that responsibility for the choices made is on those really involved. This gives them the incentive to be more invested in the process in the short- and long-term.<br>•   You like to have projections for where group decisions are headed. You want to get as much information as possible about your potential success so that all involved will feel positive about the process in which you are engaging.<br>"
var StartupMain="<h3>Startup Mentality</h3>•  You prefer quick decision-making. You don’t like to labor over things, probably because you can learn what to change or adjust if you get things moving and find out what is and isn’t going to work.<br>•  You don’t see decision-making as burdensome and are not perfectionistic about it. You take a pragmatic approach because you’d rather fine-tune the process than wait around too long. The quicker the ball gets rolling, the more promptly you can get it rolling smoothly.<br>"

var GeneralHealthVeryLow="<h3>General Health and Physical Resources</h3>• You probably already know that you are not in good health. There may be a variety of contributing factors, as there are for many people, but if you don’t take your physical health more seriously, it’s going to be difficult to achieve sustainable exceptionality in your life.<br>• You can make the needed changes, even if you’ve struggled with some of these things for a long time. Weight, diet, and exercise are stressors for many people, but at the same time, a lot of people find reasonable adjustments to make and rebuild their physical lives.<br>• Your health begins with doing simple things to feel better. Walking on a daily basis, even for ten minutes, makes a big impact on your health. Eating unprocessed foods helps tremendously. Getting support from dietary professionals can take a lot of pressure off as well, especially when you find someone you trust and feel supported by.<br>•   Once you make the decision to make some changes, that alone will make you feel better. It’s not about changing everything either. That’s an easy trap to fall into. Decide on one or two things you can do to feel better physically, and then follow through. Both parts are necessary. After that, you will feel better about what you are doing and be able to add new elements to your routine that will contribute to your overall health. One step at a time, literally and figuratively.<br>"
var GeneralHealthLow="<h3>General Health and Physical Resources</h3>• You take particularly good care of your health. This may mean that you don’t eat well or that you don’t take the time to exercise. Both of these are necessary if you want to avoid unnecessary chronic stress.<br>•    If you don’t take care of your body, your body cannot take care of you. Keeping a healthy weight, taking good care of your eyes and teeth, and incorporating a range of nutrient-rich foods is essential to feeling good not just physically, but emotionally, mentally, and spiritually.<br>•  Looking at ways to make simple adjustments can make a big difference, whether it’s cooking several simple healthy meals for the week over the prior weekend or adding a few brisk walks to your weekly routine. Moving away from processed foods, if you eat them a lot, can also be key and make a huge difference.<br>•   Keeping your annual checkups is also important, be it going to the dentist or getting your eyes checked. Your general physical is also critical because while you may go years without concerns, when they come up, it’s important to address them promptly. It’s easy to take your health for granted or assume your body will take care of you, but it doesn’t work that way. You have to take care of it. As you improve at it, the results will speak for themselves.<br>"
var GeneralHealthMedium="<h3>General Health and Physical Resources</h3>•  You participate in the maintenance of your physical health but are, perhaps, as vigilant as you could be or would like to be.<br>•  This may mean that you have not taken as good of care of your body as you would be beneficial to you.<br>•  Health is largely about routines, so seeing where you can incorporate simple things into your weekly routine will take the pressure off you and enable you to live with less stress.<br>•   Taking a moment to decide what days you want to exercise and how you can improve your diet are a great help to improving your quality of life. You’re worth it, as is your long-term well-being and sense of purpose. Exceptionality comes through doing the little things because when combined, they really add up to an exceptional life.<br>"
var GeneralHealthHigh="<h3>General Health and Physical Resources</h3>•    You realize that everything starts with your physical health, that the degree to which you take care of your body affects your overall well-being.<br>• The fact that you take care of your body puts you in a better position to address other concerns as they arise. If you weren’t taking care of your diet or putting in the requisite exercise, you would probably struggle more with life’s other stresses.<br>• Since physical health is paramount, you might also reflect on other daily maintenance that will augment the quality of your life. Connecting with yourself emotionally is important, so writing your thoughts and feelings down on a regular basis may be helpful. You’re already supporting the body, so you’ll be able to process other parts of your life more easily because of this.<br>•  Taking time for relaxation is an important part of the healing process. Complementing exercise with rest and time to unwind are vital too.<br>"
var GeneralHealthVeryHigh="<h3>General Health and Physical Resources</h3>•    You do a superb job of tending to your overall physical health and meeting your essential needs. This makes it easier to deal with the other hurdles of life as they present themselves.<br>•   You understand that taking care of your body is key to healthy living, ranging from how you eat and your weight to having regular dental and optical checkups. By tending to these, you’ve already giving yourself a significant boost up in life.<br>• Maintaining these practices will continue to serve you well and will help you avoid the chronic stresses that many people deal with.<br>"

var BeliefsVeryLow="<h3>Resilience — Beliefs</h3>•   The less clear you are about your purpose in life, the more vulnerable you are to stress and the more difficult it is to live fully.<br>•   Since you are not really motivated by your values, you may have difficulty living with a sense of purpose and gaining a sense of fulfillment from that purpose on a daily basis.<br>•   You need to dig into the ground of who you are to find out what really makes you tick, something that beneath the surface, something at the core of who you are. No one else can do this for you, but they can help you. Without this, you will remain vulnerable to chronic stress and find pursuing your ideal life very difficult.<br>•  Writing may be a good place to start. Letting the pen or keyboard flow as you begin to uncover what you really care about can be very helpful. Grounding yourself in things that help you connect your mind to your body may also be beneficial. Yoga of various sorts are great for this, as are different types of meditation. You’ll need to explore these to see what best fits you. Taking the time to do so is a valuable investment that can, by itself, help you feel encouraged and supported on your journey to exceptionality.<br>"
var BeliefsLow="<h3>Resilience — Beliefs</h3>•   Whether you have a sense of conviction or not about what gives your life meaning, you don’t really act on it or live out of it. This makes your life harder.<br>•   If what you value or believe has gotten lost along the way—and life can do that to a person—you have the opportunity to gather yourself. At the end of the day, this is your life and its purpose is what you decide it to be. This is very empowering.<br>•    Part of living with a strong sense of purpose is being organized, at least to some degree. This means knowing what small steps to take in order to begin to put your hopes and dreams into action. Having others support you in this will be invaluable. They can help you get started and see that your dreams are realizable. They can also help you deal with whatever fears you face along the way.<br>•    Then the key is to follow through. Once following through on what you value becomes a habit, part of your daily life, it gets much easier. This doesn’t usually happen overnight, but it can become part of your life for the long-term if you want it to. Great successes are achieved through doing things in manageable chunks. You can do this, too!<br>"
var BeliefsMedium="<h3>Resilience — Beliefs</h3>•    You tend to have an idea of what you want out of life but you may either doubt yourself or not know how to put it into action.<br>• The fact that you do know what you want is a great start. So build on that. Whatever purpose you feel in your bones is yours and no one else’s. In other words, embrace what you feel, what you value. This is key to living into your own exceptionality: believing in yourself.<br>•  There are likely areas of your life in which you do live out of your values, so acknowledge these as part of growing more of your life into this. Journaling about your successes and future hopes will likely bring into greater focus where you want to spend your time.<br>• Perhaps with someone else’s help—someone who has experience—begin to develop a plan for how to fashion your life to more fully reflect your values and how you want to spend your time. Including exercises that help keep you grounded in yourself will aid you in doing this. You might (if you haven’t already) incorporate relaxation breathing or gentle yoga into your routines to help you stay integrated as you venture out. The stability of a connected body benefits and adventurous soul.<br>"
var BeliefsHigh="<h3>Resilience — Beliefs</h3>•  You have a good sense of what gives your life meaning and order. This puts you in a place where you are already ahead of the curve because you are living out of your mission, not someone else’s.<br>• Much of life’s stresses are a result of spending time doing and thinking about things that are not a priority or seem peripheral to really living. You decision to live out of who you are means avoiding much of this, even though you feel life’s stresses too.<br>•  Continue living out of who you are because this alone will help you operate from a place of abundance and stability.<br>•   A variety of activities can help you stay connected to yourself along the way. If not already doing some of these, you might consider journaling on an ongoing basis. Writing down your thoughts, hopes, and dreams can help you to feel even better about them. Meditation or yoga can also be beneficial to your sense of connection to yourself and the world around you.<br>"
var BeliefsVeryHigh="<h3>Resilience — Beliefs</h3>•  You live out of a sense of purpose, which makes your life more enjoyable and meaningful.<br>•   The majority of your life is enhanced by feeling that what you are doing is what you want to be doing, that you are able to contribute to the world around you in ways that fit you as a person.<br>•   Your life will continue to be an outgrowth of your values and should be. Remaining open to new ways this may manifest itself in your life will help you to continue to grow, which is important to you.<br>•    It’s also helpful to keep in mind that it’s easy to get expectations that because you are following your heart, things will go well or meet your expectations. And they may, but it’s beneficial to not get caught up in the results as much as it is enjoying how you participate in your own life. That’s, in and of itself, invaluable. Good for you!<br>"

var WellnessVeryLow="<h3>Resilience — Wellness</h3>•   You either never learned or haven’t taken advantage of techniques that can help you manage your emotions, especially in times of stress.<br>•   You don’t take time to meditate or consciously relax on a regular basis, so you are likely overwhelmed by aspects of daily life.<br>•   If you haven’t been exposed to these types of practices, now is your chance. Meditation, relaxation, and mindfulness exercises can really help you maintain a sense of calm even though you may be under pressure of various sorts.<br>•    Practicing relaxed breathing or playing the script out so that you can see that you’ll survive even a harsh scenario can provide unbelievable relief in otherwise seemingly unmanageable situations. Learning these tools are key to living with reserve, to maintaining stability through change.<br>"
var WellnessLow="<h3>Resilience — Wellness</h3>  The chances are, you don’t take time for yourself, by yourself every day or even every week.<br>•   As a result, you haven’t cultivated the habit of caring for yourself in this very personal way. This means that you are probably stressed when you don’t need or have to be. Or maybe you’re more stressed than you could be.<br>•  Learning how to intervene on stress in simple and productive ways is extremely beneficial because your mind can help you manage your emotions when properly trained.<br>•   Pursuing a habit of meditation, relaxation, and/or mindfulness will help you become a more resilient person because you won’t be as subject to the emotional ups and downs that you are today. This offers you an immeasurably more pleasant and satisfying life.<br>"
var WellnessMedium="<h3>Resilience — Wellness</h3> •   You have experience utilizing things like meditation and/or mindfulness exercises, but you probably have a hard time sustaining them as part of your life.<br>• You also may know some techniques for intervening on your emotions in times of stress, but you would benefit from employing them more frequently and/or learning additional ways to manage your emotions.<br>•  Taking time for yourself every day is in some ways counterintuitive in a society that tells you you’re valuable based on what you “do.” Nevertheless, cultivating this habit is invaluable toward living a life that is calm and enjoyable.<br>•    So you might begin revisiting the ways of spending time with yourself that you benefited from previously, be it meditation, relaxation exercises, or something else. There are a number of ways to get reconnected to yourself. You might even do some journaling as a way to generate ideas or explore what you really want to get out of this.<br>"
var WellnessHigh="<h3>Resilience — Wellness</h3> • You make an effort to spend time with yourself on a regular basis. This means that you understand the value of connecting with yourself and your body as part of living a full and healthy life.<br>•  Being intentional about this type of self-care gives you a leg up in your pursuit of an exceptional life. These types of exercises help you live a positive life.<br>•  You may prefer mindfulness exercises, yoga, or meditation as part of your routines. Whatever approach you take, staying connected to yourself is an excellent practice. Participating in exercises that bring you back to center, to the place where your mind and body intersect, is such a valuable tool.<br>•    Your mind is a very valuable instrument, especially its ability to redirect or intervene upon your emotions. Nice job taking advantage of this when faced with stress.<br>"
var WellnessVeryHigh="<h3>Resilience — Wellness</h3> • You do an excellent job of using your thoughts to help you manage your emotions.<br>•   By intervening on the stresses of your life, you create a greater resilience when mild and more intense happenings occur in your life. This allows you to live from a place of greater sanctuary and confidence.<br>•   Continuing to care for yourself through meditation, mindfulness, and/or relaxation will enable you live with reserve through situations that might otherwise be difficult to manage.<br>•   Your exceptionality relies on maintaining practices that keep you grounded in the present and in who you are. Keep up the good work!<br>"

var EmpathyVeryLow="<h3>Empathy</h3>•   You are not attentive to the people around you and have a hard time relating to their situation, whether they’re going through things you’ve been through or not.<br>•  You experience a distance between others travails and your own. You may, as a result, find listening to others difficult and don’t see the benefit of taking the time to do so.<br>•    Without other people, life is hard and stressful. Heck, it’s hard with people, so taking some solid steps to improve how you connect with people will have immeasurable results in your own life. It’s going to be very difficult to manage your own stresses if you feel disconnected from the world around you.<br>•  You might begin by trying to connect with yourself emotionally. This is key in relating to others. Doing daily journaling would be a good start: it’ll give you a place to begin to make sense of your own interior world. You might also consult with someone who has professional experience sorting out your experiences and emotions. You don’t have to do this alone.<br>"
var EmpathyLow="<h3>Empathy</h3>•   You may be able to empathize with those very close to you, but generally speaking, you have a hard time understanding what others are feeling and experiencing when they relate their lives to you.<br>•    You may try to listen closely to them, but you have a hard time investing in relationships with many people because you don’t really know how to create the connection that you see others developing.<br>• Doing some simple work on yourself may be a helpful place to start because connecting with others often begins with connecting with yourself. Journaling can be a very helpful tool to explore your reactions and responses to the world around you. You may also find that mindfulness exercises or meditation help you feel yourself, your thoughts and emotions.<br>•    Therapeutic support might also be beneficial because there are likely contributing factors to your occasional disconnection from others. A lot of people have this as part of their lives, so going in with an open mind is essential to making strides that will help you live more fully into your own exceptionality.<br>"
var EmpathyMedium="<h3>Empathy</h3>•    You care about other people and are able, to some degree, to relate to them. You may relate better to people who are more like you, but you likely at times even see where people who have much different lives than you are coming from.<br>•  You like doing things for others and may even go out of your way to do so, but more generally you do this intermittently. You care about others and think about them, but you’re also busy with your own life and attentions.<br>•  Because you have the ability to hear where others are coming from, identifying simple ways to do even a little more of this will enhance your quality of life. Taking a few minutes to really listen to the people who are central in your life and asking them something meaningful about what they’re talking about is important.<br>•    Tending to people in even the everydayness of life matters and will help you operate at a higher level in your own life. As a result, your relationships will continue to grow and your stress will be less noticeable and more manageable.<br>"
var EmpathyHigh="<h3>Empathy</h3>•  You have a knack for understanding where others are coming from. You are able to get a sense of what they’re going through, which shows that you are a caring person.<br>•  You’re willing to see the world from another angle, which means that you don’t live in your own little world.<br>•  This is an invaluable tool to creating both lasting long-term relationships and kind short-term ones. People need people, be it in passing or in more sustained contexts, who show genuine compassion.<br>• Continue doing things that help you stay connected to yourself. Journaling on a regular basis can be very helpful. Since you likely are a good listener, it can help to have an outlet for your thoughts and reflections. Meditation and relaxation exercises can also be helpful.<br>"
var EmpathyVeryHigh="<h3>Empathy</h3>•  You have a heart for other people and see them as worth relating to on a deep level. You have a keen ability to put yourself in their shoes, regardless of how much like you they are.<br>• Your empathetic ability largely results from your ability to listen others, not just their words but how they are feeling. You also enjoy giving without expectation of getting something back and often have a sense of what they will really enjoy or appreciate.<br>•    There’s not much of a suggestion to make here. Keep up the good work. Empathy is essential to a fulfilling life.<br>•   Taking time for yourself, to listen to yourself is probably part of your life. Keeping this going will help you nourish yourself while giving to others.<br>"
var EQOpennessVeryLow="<h3>Emotional IQ</h3>•    You don’t really like new ways of thinking and don’t find a lot of value in experiencing the natural world. You prefer the world you’ve created for yourself and the familiarity it offers you.<br>•    You don’t make attempts to challenge your own worldview and your readily held ideals. Doing so may seem like a waste of time or might even be scary to you.<br>•    Whatever your sacred calves/idols are, without exposing them to the light of day, they’re not going to carry you very far. Security is a much more precarious thing that people often realize. Without engaging different perspectives, your own beliefs may lose their real strength. Every idea needs something to bounce off of for its own rejuvenation. Otherwise, it becomes stale.<br>•  Change and growth are absolutely necessary in order to achieve an exceptional life. Doing simple things like reading a book that explores something you’re interested in, even if you don’t fully agree with it could be very helpful to your life. You are much more that your life up to this point. You are whatever horizons you can see to and eventually over!<br>"
var EQOpennessLow="<h3>Emotional IQ</h3>•    You’re not particularly curious about looking at the world through different lenses. You like the lenses you’ve got and have spent time polishing them.<br>•    Your focus on your own way of thinking may have left you with blind spots when relating to others who see the world differently from you. You may even discount them simply because they disagree with you.<br>•    If you do immediately look past other people who don’t wear your ideological spectacles, then you probably have some growing to do. The world is a much bigger place than any one person, so embracing (or even casually exploring) other people’s experiences and points of view can shed amazing light on what life can be. You might start by trying to listen in a new way. People of all walks of life have something to offer.<br>•   If you take yourself seriously most of the time, you might consider taking some time for meditation or yoga. This type of activity will help you spend time with yourself—body, mind, spirit, and emotions—and will give you a chance to see what is inside of you on a daily basis. You’ve already encountered this in a visceral way in the Reserve Camp, and now you can take part of that with you. Being with yourself will likely influence the type of attention that you give others. Connecting with ourselves makes us more available to others.<br>"
var EQOpennessMedium="<h3>Emotional IQ</h3>• You like exposure to new ways of thinking and seeing the world to a degree, but you also find comfort in the familiar and the everyday. You like things that you have a history with, even though your interest can be easily piqued by a new idea or point of view.<br>•   You probably don’t take yourself too seriously most of the time, but when you do, you may have a hard time snapping out of it.<br>• When you find yourself glomming too strongly onto an old idea—i.e. one that no longer really serves your life today—just take a moment to step back and say, “You know, that doesn’t really work for me anymore.” Many people will go with what’s familiar regardless of its ability to contribute to their lives any longer.<br>•  Challenge yourself to expose yourself to new ideas. This may mean reading a book that will push you to grow in new ways or watching YouTube videos about a different philosophical or theological approach to the world. This type of growth enhances many other areas of life.<br>"
var EQOpennessHigh="<h3>Emotional IQ</h3>•   You like variety in your life and seek it out. This may be in people or through the exploration of different ideologies, religions, philosophies, or other types of practices.<br>• Your curiosity also helps you connect with other people because you tend to understand where they’re coming from. Your exposure to the world means that you can connect with a variety of people at whatever levels they are comfortable.<br>•  Continuing to explore yourself in ways that fit your personality will feed your thirst for life in many forms. Including others as you see fit will probably add to that.<br>•  Writing about your experiences may also be beneficial at times—just for you. Journaling is a powerful way to integrate the paths you’ve trod.<br>"
var EQOpennessVeryHigh="<h3>Emotional IQ</h3>•   You really appreciate and enjoy being exposed to new ideas and ways of thinking. You also have a great appreciation for encounters with the natural world and all that it offers.<br>•  Your openness keeps you from getting stuck in emotional and intellectual ruts because you’re willing to face new challenges.<br>•   Your willingness to consider different ways of thinking and being keeps life fresh for you. May it ever stay that way.<br>• Your openness may trigger curiosity in others. When this happens, you may be able to gently expose them to something new too. If they are not as flexible as you, the chance to plant a seed that might bloom later is a beautiful thing to be a part of.<br>"

var JudgmentVeryLow="<h3>Judgment</h3>• When you relate to people, you just see them as people. You don’t see them according to their social class, age, education, or the like. That doesn’t mean that you’re unaware of these, but they don’t play a role in how you treat them.<br>• You judge people based on who they are and how they treat you and others. That is the real measure of a person in your eyes.<br>•   The way you see the world likely gives you a sense of hope and purpose, both of which are essential to living a fulfilling, more serene life.<br>•  Taking time here and there to reflect on the joys you’ve experienced with others can enhance your sense of your place in the world too.<br>"
var JudgmentLow="<h3>Judgment</h3>• You don’t really see people as being better or worse than you, whatever that means to you. You try to see people as people, as individuals, each with different circumstances but with something in common regardless.<br>• You may at times find yourself giving a bit of preferential treatment to someone based on age or social class, but it’s the exception in your case, not the rule.<br>•  Because you tend to foster relationships based on what you have in common with others, your relationships likely give you healthy energy and a sense of purpose.<br>•   When you fall short of your own goals in how you see and evaluate others, don’t be too hard on yourself. It might even be helpful to just sit with your own sense of care and compassion for others in a meditation session or write about a neat encounter you had with someone. It’s just as important—if not more—to validate your successes.<br>"
var JudgmentMedium="<h3>Judgment</h3>•  You relate to a lot of people just as they are, but you also have an internal barometer of whether the people you are interacting with are, by whatever scale, above or below you. This could be in terms of income, social class, or some other measure.<br>•  You try to not to treat certain social classes or ages better than others, but you do. It’s likely not conscious and it’s probably not constant, but it comes up at times and you may even notice it.<br>•  Redirecting yourself when you notice yourself responding less well to certain types of people can be helpful. Listening more closely to their voice or identifying one thing about them that you have in common (it could be just your shared humanity, the desire to be treated decently that we all share) can help you intervene on your unintentional judgment of them.<br>•    Taking time to slow down and smell the roses is also helpful. This means being in the moment with whomever your are interacting. Practices like meditation and yoga, or mindfulness and relaxation exercises, can increase your ability to slow down and witness the beauty of a moment or interaction—or simply endure it with more grace. Both of these will increase the quality of your life and likely someone else’s.<br>"
var JudgmentHigh="<h3>Judgment</h3>•    You generally find your place in the world by identifying who is above and below you. This could be socially, professionally, personally, financially, or some other measure.<br>•  You use external markers to position yourself among the world you encounter. This also means that you can earn a “better” position by applying yourself. In other words, your value is negotiable to, not inherent.<br>•    If your value is not inherent, life is, by definition, stressful. How you judge the world is usually a reflection of how you judge yourself. So a good beginning can be to get in better touch with your self-image. Journaling can really help with this.<br>• You might also look for other ways to find some peace in your own life. Meditation and yoga have shown to greatly reduce stress and help people find more calm in their lives. Both of these help people connect with themselves amidst usually busy lives.<br>"
var JudgmentVeryHigh="<h3>Judgment</h3>•    You see pretty much everyone as either being above you or below you. There’s not a lot of gray.<br>•    You treat certain groups preferentially based on age and social class.<br>• Identifying what you have in common, how you are like others, is essential to forming bonds with people, and relationships are a significant factor in living a life not burdened by stress. You might begin by listing some of your family or friends, and instead of seeing how you are different, identify traits and interests that you have in common.<br>•    If you are in constant evaluation of how you are better or worse than others, you would probably benefit from getting professional support so that you can begin to work through whatever has contributed to this in your own life. If you continue to carry this with you—and it can be pervasive—it can really hamper your life and living out your dreams.<br>"
var CourtesyVeryLow="<h3>Courtesy</h3>•  You’re not concerned with being courteous in your encounters with the world around you.<br>•    You don’t apologize for your actions. You have things to accomplish and you do them. If other people are affected along the way, that’s just the way it goes. Life is not convenient for everyone all the time.<br>•    Treating people with dignity and respect, regardless of the context, may be inconvenient in some instances in the short term, but it’s invaluable in the long term. People don’t like to be around rude people (and not being courteous is rude when practiced repeatedly), so your actions invariably will affect you negatively at some point.<br>•   It’s probably time to change, to consider doing this differently. If you have a really hard time being courteous to others, you probably need to discuss this with someone who can help you improve at it. If you don’t, you may end up in a pattern of self-destruction or burn the bridges you’ve built. Begin growing your social skills repertoire. People deserve your respect: they are just as valuable as you are. It’s a simple thing to adjust and will enhance even small moments of your life.<br>"
var CourtesyLow="<h3>Courtesy</h3>•  You don’t really think about saying “thank you” to people when they’re polite or apologizing when you might’ve been inconsiderate.<br>• You just go along, focused on what you want to focus on. You’re less concerned with how your actions might impact others. If you’re immune to the way you interact with the world around you, you are undoubtedly making your life harder. Whether you like it or not, your quality of life depends on other people. They are part of life for better or worse.<br>•    You might benefit from making some changes to how you interact. You might start with some journaling. You could use it to reflect on recent exchanges you’ve had with people or to get a sense of what drives you when you’re amidst others. What is your motivation when you’re going about your day?<br>• You might also consider learning more about social etiquette, what to say and when to say.

var CourtesyMedium="<h3>Courtesy</h3>•   You appreciate being treated kindly, and you sometimes thank them and sometimes forget. You’re not oblivious to the kindness directed your way, but you’re simply not as vigilant about It as some are.<br>•    You sometimes apologize when you’ve wronged someone.<br>•   Your level of courtesy varies, which probably means that it’s not something that you see as essential to life. And that’s fine. Nevertheless, it may affect some aspects of your life, so it’s worth considering how important courtesy is in life.<br>•    If you decide that it’s something you want to engage in more than you currently do, it requires two things: 1) the effort to do it consistently, and 2) taking time to connect with yourself. The latter of these is usually easier to ignore, but doing simple things like meditation or relaxation exercises go a long way toward living your life in the world in a more expansive, satisfying way.<br>"

You treat people well and apologize when necessary. Focusing on the positive is important too because that’s the real marker of your life.<br>"
var CourtesyVeryHigh="<h3>Courtesy</h3>• You not only care about others, you acknowledge their value through being courteous and kind toward them as you trundle about your daily life.<br>• You are also not hesitant to make amends if you feel you have been inconsiderate or may have harmed someone else.<br>•  Your willingness to take the time to show others that they value is a great offering to the world. Keep doing it! (You will)<br>•   You set an example for others when it comes to how to treat people, whether they’re familiar to you or strangers. Whether others act the same way is not as important as how you carry yourself.<br>"

var EmotionallyFlexibleVeryLow="<h3>Flexibility</h3>•   You’re not really interested in facing the losses and lessons that life presents you.<br>•  You don’t want to feel whatever emotions accompany such things and would rather just soldier on unaffected.<br>•    This is really not possible. Life affects you, just as it does everyone else. So getting in touch with yourself, with your feelings, disappointments, insecurities, and even sadness about how things have gone are part of healing and making your experiences assets rather than liabilities.<br>•    If you find yourself wanting to avoid the consequences of life or the choices you’ve made, you probably need to discuss it with someone else. You may feel more comfortable beginning with writing it down by yourself. It may even help to read it to a trusted confidante. Whatever the case, the trials you’ve experienced can either be carried with you the rest of the way more made into something new. It’s your choice.<br>"
var EmotionallyFlexibleLow="<h3>Flexibility</h3>•   You’re not the best at embracing the hardness of life, the reality that failure and obstacles are part of the journey. You may tackle some of life’s challenges very well, but there are likely other areas you find less palatable and therefore avoid.<br>•   It’s hard for you to not take yourself too seriously. You may think that being hard on yourself makes you stronger or better, or you may just do it as a habit.<br>•    Whatever the situation is, you need to change if you want to have a more whole life. You might consider finding ways to ease your own burdens. This could be through regular journaling. Sharing this with someone else might also be helpful because the chances are, if you’re willing, you’ll find out others experience the same things you do.<br>•    Taking time to engage in activities that connect your body, mind, spirit, and emotions are also helpful. This might be through meditation or yoga, both of which seek to help human beings integrate more of themselves.<br>"
var EmotionallyFlexibleMedium="<h3>Flexibility</h3>•    Sometimes you learn from your whatever lessons life seems to be teaching you, and at other times you want to run the other way or ignore them.<br>• This may be because you take failures personally or because you don’t want to take yourself too seriously but find it hard not to at times. Everyone deals with this to some degree, though, so you’re not alone.<br>•  Keep your head up when things don’t go your way. Doing simple things like full-body muscle relaxation exercises or relaxed breathing can help you keep perspective so that you can maintain a sense of calm during whatever stresses arise.<br>•    Remember that stress can be redirected by your mind, so learning new ways to cope with your own sometimes negative thinking is a great tool. Journaling can help you get a better handle on what’s happening and relieve stress. The same can be said for meditation.<br>"
var EmotionallyFlexibleHigh="<h3>Flexibility</h3>•  You have a wonderful ability to laugh at yourself, to not take yourself too seriously.<br>• This keeps you in good standing with yourself and others because it communicates that you are not trying to keep everybody to an unreasonable standard. You want to learn from life, and others likely see that in you.<br>•    You are fortunate to be able to learn from experiences of loss. You may be able to pass this along to others along the way.<br>•    Taking time for relaxation or mindfulness exercises will buoy your emotional health as well, particularly because you value being able to connect with your own thoughts and feelings. Writing them down may also be a good tool.<br>"
var EmotionallyFlexibleVeryHigh="<h3>Flexibility</h3>•  You are extremely emotionally flexible, which means that you can adjust to life as it happens and in very effective ways.<br>•  Whatever happens to you, you try to learn from it, to see it as a teacher rather than a failure or shortcoming of yours.<br>•   You are in touch with your own emotions, which is a wonderful asset. This also means that you will be able to let others feel their feelings without having to intervene out of your own discomfort. You offer them a great gift by doing this.<br>•    Taking time to reflect on your own emotions can be helpful too. Writing your feelings down and consciously processing them will help you continue to integrate them and keep you light on your feet.<br>"

In going forward, utilizing what has really worked for you—doing the things that contribute to living a meaningful, purposive life—are key to keeping your momentum. It is also vital to hone in on whatever patterns in your life are holding you back, are weighing you down. Most everyone has these, so what they are is not as important as how you can tackle them. As has been said, “Life’s not about what happens to you but how you respond what happens to you.” This is so empowering because if life is the sum of your choices, the sky really is the limit. Take as honest a look as you can at what sets you back the most and begin learning better responses and strategies for dealing with them. This may be uncomfortable at times, maybe even overwhelming. So what! It’s your life, and it’s worth making the most of, regardless of the price that has to be paid. Plus, you’re not going to get a refund at the end of it all. Your life, instead, will be measured by the risks you’ve been willing to take and the heart you put into learning and growing into the fullness of who you are.')

The key going forward is how you approach the parts of your life that are holding you back. You are likely here, learning how to live with reserve, because you realize that living from a place of stability and confidence is foundational to the type of life you want. The canyon that you stand in front of is your life, and it’s beautiful and deep. But it may also be daunting to drop down into and navigate because stress tends to magnify the problem. The descent may appear treacherous, perhaps even more sheer than it actually is. So the key then is to focus on the solution, and by doing so, the solution will grow. The gorgeous canyon may be transformed into rolling hills that while steep at times are also littered with fresh, rejuvenating waters. That’s why your approach to this transition in your life is so important. So look through the material you’ve been given, see what fits, and go for it! You may find yourself peering into the most breathtaking view around: your true self. At the end of the day, it’s the landscape that you can most fully enjoy and grow into the bounty you hope it to be.')
